    <div class="album-info-together">
        <p>Picking up where their previous release, the seventh mini album “The Star Chapter: SANCTUARY,” left off, “The Star Chapter: TOGETHER” marks the final page of “The Star Chapter.” It tells the story of how “we” save each other by calling each other's names. The word “TOGETHER,” which is also a part of the group's name, was chosen to make the album even more special. <br><br>
        This album speaks to the true meaning of “TOGETHER.” From the feeling of being with someone you care about even if the world is turned upside down (“Upside Down Kiss”), to the determination to save that person and move forward into the world together (“Beautiful Strangers”), a fatal love that you would willingly fall into (“Ghost Girl”), a leisurely time just for two (“Sunday Driver”), the desire to understand and resemble the person you love (“Dance With You”), the happiness that comes from sharing (“Take My Half”), the encouragement to move forward to tomorrow even on sleepless nights (“Bird of Night”), and all the way to the happiness that only comes when “we” are together (“Song of the Stars”). TOMORROW X TOGETHER has musically captured the essence and meaning of "TOGETHER."</p>

    <h2>Upside Down Kiss</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-together">A world that tries to drop you and me. It is a song that expresses the desire to kiss you even when it is on the verge of splitting in the opposite direction. The minimalist yet addictive bass, 80's sensibilities, and charming melodies create a sexy atmosphere. The sensual lyrics such as "We are freer as if laughing at gravity and touching our lips" are impressive. Yeonjun participated in the lyrics, doubling the charm of the song. It is a song in the Pop genre that combines Hip-Hop and New Jack Swing.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-together"><strong>[Intro: Soobin]</strong>
    Oh-oh
    Yeah

    <strong>[Verse 1: Soobin, Yeonjun, Beomgyu, Huening Kai]</strong>
    네 눈빛 속에
    거꾸로 비친 my face
    Keep your eyes on me (Ah, ah, ah)
    Baby, don't freeze
    정반대의 something
    본능이 알아봤지
    달아오른 skin (Ah, ah, ah)
    너 말곤 쉿

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    (Uh) 너와 내 두 발이
    서로 다른 세상에
    묶여 닿을 수가 없대도
    That's what I like
    어려운 game
    궤도를 비껴, I don't give a thing

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Soobin]</strong>
    Baby girl, let's get freaky
    중력을 비웃고
    입술이 닿을 듯 말 듯
    우린 더 자유로워
    Baby, I'll make it easy
    뒤집힌 그대로
    나의 아랫입술이
    너의 윗입술로 (입술로)

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    Upside down, upside down (Kiss, kiss)
    Upside down, upside down (Kiss, kiss)
    Upside down, upside down (Kiss, kiss)
    Upside down, upside down (Kiss, kiss; Ayy, ayy)

    <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun, Taehyun]</strong>
    포개지는 네 입술 (Your lips)
    그 위에서, swing groove (Groovin')
    마치 N과 S극 (Like that)
    떼어 내지 못해 착붙
    몸은 그냥 가는 대로
    가득해 오감은 너로 뭘 해도 남들관 달러?
    Sip it like an affogato
    그렇게 우린 탐해 서로를, yeah

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai, Soobin]</strong>
    (Uh) 어떤 영화 같지
    서로 다른 중력쯤
    좀 더 극적인 장치일 뿐
    It's no surprise
    Don't need no changes
    내 모습 그대로 입 맞출게

    <strong>[Chorus: Beomgyu, Taehyun]</strong>
    Baby girl, let's get freaky
    중력을 비웃고
    입술이 닿을 듯 말 듯
    우린 더 자유로워
    Baby, I'll make it easy
    뒤집힌 그대로
    나의 아랫입술이
    너의 윗입술로 (입술로)

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    Upside down, upside down (Kiss, kiss)
    Upside down, upside down (Kiss, kiss)
    Upside down, upside down (Kiss, kiss)
    Upside down, upside down (Kiss, kiss)

    <strong>[Outro: Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>
    Upside down, upside down (Kiss, kiss)</p>

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-together">In your gaze,
    My face reflects upside down
    Keep your eyes on me
    Baby don't freeze
    Something completely opposite
    My instincts knew it right away
    Heated skin
    (No one) but you, shh

    You and I, our feet are tied to different worlds
    Even if they say we can't ever meet 
    That's what I like, a difficult game
    Off track, I don't give a shit
    Baby girl let's get freaky, laughing at gravity 
    Our lips are just shy of touching, we're freer than ever
    Baby I'll make it easy, just as we're flipped
    My lower lip meets your upper lip,
    Our lips

    Upside down upside down kiss kiss
    Upside down upside down kiss kiss
    Upside down upside down kiss kiss
    Upside down upside down kiss kiss

    Your lips overlapping with mine (Your lips!)
    Swing, groove on top of them (Groovin!)
    Like N and S (Like that!)
    Can't be pulled apart, we're stuck tight

    Our bodies just go with the flow, 
    All five senses filled with you
    Whatever we do, it's different from others
    Sip it like an affogato
    That's how we desire each other, yeah

    Feels like a movie
    Two people under different gravities
    It's just a more dramatic set up
    It's no surprise
    Don't need no changes
    I'll kiss you just the way 1 am

    Baby girl let's get freaky, laughing at gravity
    Our lips are just shy of touching, we're freer than ever
    Baby I'll make it easy, just as we're flipped
    My lower lip meets your upper lip,
    Our lips

    Upside down upside down kiss kiss
    Upside down upside down kiss kiss
    Upside down upside down kiss kiss
    Upside down upside down kiss kiss</p>

    <h2>Beautiful Strangers</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-together">This is the title track of their 4th full-length album, featuring a contrast between dreamy piano lines and intense synthesizer sounds. A hip-hop genre song with a trap rhythm. The sweet melody and explosive accompaniment harmonize with TOMORROW X TOGETHER's overwhelming performance. It depicts the story of 'me' who grows with the power given to you and 'we' who are different and more beautiful. TOMORROW X TOGETHER concludes the narrative of 'Star Chapter' with this song.</p>

    Oh

    목소리는 점점 커져 (커져)
    네가 건넨 힘을 따라서

    <strong>[Refrain: Taehyun]</strong>

    네 꺾인 날개와 내뿔 흉터는 마치 타투 (Yeah)
    우리 사랑의 증거, oh

    <strong>[Refrain: Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>

    두렵지 않을 이유

    Like a child looking for their mother

    <span class="close-together" onclick="closeModal('ghost_girl')">&times;</span>
    <h2>Ghost Girl</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-together">A solo song that maximizes Yeonjun's stylish charm. It is a song in the Reggae Rock genre that contains both intensity and lyricism, giving it a unique feel. The contrast between the rhythmic groove of the verse and the chorus, and the sound of the pre-chorus is captivating. Yeonjun's charismatic singing is added to the track, which combines dynamic guitar, lively drums, and bass. Straightforward lyrics such as "Hold my heart and hand over everything I have while being dominated" stick in your ears. Yeonjun participates in the lyrics and tells a fatal love story that he is willing to fall in love with a ghostly partner that he thinks of all day long.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-together"><strong>[Chorus]</strong>
    You can be my ghost girl, you can take my soul, girl
    나를 잃은 채 전부 잊을게 real world
    You can be my ghost girl
    You can be my ghost girl, 내 심장을 틀어쥐어
    지배당한 채 나의 모든 걸 넘겨
    You can be my ghost girl

    <strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
    I feel you, 발 닿는 곳 그 어디든
    꼭 씐 듯해 너에게 전부
    질식할 듯한 감정 너만이 내 숨, 너만이 내 truth
    You're the one I don't wanna lose

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
    지독하게 열이 올라
    오늘도 널 앓아
    뒤척여 every night in my bed
    환청처럼 울린 alarm
    두 눈을 뜬 순간
    아른거리는 너의 silhouette

    <strong>[Chorus]</strong>
    You can be my ghost girl, you can take my soul, girl
    나를 잃은 채 전부 잊을게 real world
    You can be my ghost girl
    (Hey-ey-ey)
    You can be my ghost girl, 내 심장을 틀어쥐어
    지배당한 채 나의 모든 걸 넘겨
    You can be my ghost girl
    (Hey-ey-ey)

    <strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
    All of my friends, 날 보곤 답 없대
    And I don't really care, I don't really care
    지옥마저 천국일 테니, baby, 함께 있어 주길
    I love it nothing gets me scared

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
    Darling, 너와 함께라면
    걸어가 through the dark
    미친놈이래도 뭐 어때?
    너로 인해 숨 쉬는 나
    따라가, where you are
    어떤 이별조차 초월해

    <strong>[Chorus]</strong>
    You can be my ghost girl, come and take my soul, girl
    영혼을 다 쏟고도 또 건네는 heart
    You can be my ghost girl
    (Hey-еy-ey)
    You can be my ghost girl, 나를 잠식해도
    오직 너만이 나를 숨 쉬게 한걸
    You can be my ghost girl
    (Hey-ey-ey)

    <strong>[Outro]</strong>
    Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
    (You can be my ghost girl)
    Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
    (You can be my ghost girl)
    I just wanna be with you
    I just wanna stay with you
    I just wanna live and die with you

    <h2>Sunday Driver</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-together">Soobin's solo song is an easy-listening pop genre that anyone can listen to comfortably. Soobin's sweet voice blends into the upbeat track, reminiscent of a drive on a sunny day. It conveys the happiness that comes from enjoying a leisurely time with 'you' at your own pace, just like driving on a Sunday when there are few people. The rhythmic bass, drums, and refreshing guitar playing harmonize with the lovely lyrics, giving the listener a sense of freshness.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-together"><strong>[Intro]</strong>
    Sunday for, Sunday for us
    Yeah, yeah, alright

    <strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
    Woah, 적당히 따사로운
    Sun, 들뜬 시동을 걸어
    너의 최애 playlist 준비, okay
    널 데리러 갈게

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
    날 보며 웃는 널 발견한 그 순간
    느리게 시작되는 drive
    스쳐 간 옆 차선 고개를 내민
    귀여운 강아지랑 인사하는 너

    <strong>[Chorus]</strong>
    It's like Sunday for, Sunday for us
    시간마저 느리게, 느리게 가
    잡힐 듯한 풍경과 꿈같은 둘, yeah, yeah
    그 하나하나까지 눈에 담아 깊이

    <strong>[Post-Chorus]</strong>
    La, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
    Just two of us
    Sunday for, Sunday for us
    구름 위를 살랑살랑 달려 우리만의 driving

    <strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
    바다 갈까? (Go now) 멀면 어때? (Don't care)
    오른손엔 (My hand) 네 손이면 돼
    차 안은 우리만의 동전 없는 노래방이 돼
    엉터리 가사라도 좋아

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
    이렇게 우리 둘만 같이 있다면
    매일이 일요일 같아
    서두를 거 없어 느긋하게
    어차피 목적지는 네 옆의 everywhere

    <strong>[Chorus]</strong>
    It's like Sunday for, Sunday for us
    시간마저 느리게, 느리게 가
    잡힐 듯한 풍경과 꿈같은 둘, yeah, yeah
    그 하나하나까지 눈에 담아 깊이

    <strong>[Bridge]</strong>
    눈부신 노을에 이끌려 (Ah)
    경로를 벗어나 닿은 곳 (Ah-ah)
    Now I know, 잘못 든 이 길도
    영화 속 한 장면 같은걸 (같은걸)

    <strong>[Chorus]</strong>
    It's like Sunday for, Sunday for us (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
    일요일을 닮은 듯 여유로운 mood (닮 없이; Ooh, ooh, ooh)
    잡힐 듯한 풍경과 꿈같은 둘, yeah, yeah (Ooh, woah-oh)
    그 하나하나까지 눈에 담아 깊이

    <strong>[Post-Chorus]</strong>
    La, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
    Just two of us
    Sunday for, Sunday for us
    이보다 더 좋을 수는 없지 우리만의 driving</p>

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-together">Sunday for, Sunday for us
    Yeah, alright

    Woah
    A just-right warm sun
    I start the engine, a little giddy 
    Your favorite playlist all ready, OK 
    I'll come pick you up

    The moment I see you smiling at me, 
    A drive that begins slowly 
    In the next lane, passing by
    You wave at a cute puppy with its heat out

    It's like Sunday for, Sunday for us 
    Even time moves slowly, slowly
    A scenery that feels within reach and a dreamlike us
    I take in every single detail deep in my eyes

    La la la la la la
    La la la la la la la la
    La la la
    Just two of us

    Sunday for, Sunday for us
    Gently running above the clouds
    Our own kind of driving

    Should we go to the beach? (Go now)
    So what if it's far? (Don't care)
    In my right hand (My hand)
    All I need is your hand
    The car turns into our own coinless karaoke room
    Even messed up lyrics are fine

    When it's just the two of us like this, 
    Every day feels like Sunday
    There's no need to rush, we take it slow 
    The destination is beside you wherever you are, everywhere

    It's like Sunday for, Sunday for us 
    Even time moves slowly, slowly
    A scenery that feels within reach and a dreamlike us
    I take in every single detail deep in my eyes

    Drawn by the dazzling sunset
    We arrive somewhere off the planned route
    Now I know, even this wrong turn 
    Feels like a scene from a movie

    It's like Sunday for, Sunday for us 
    A relaxed mood, like a Sunday
    A scenery that feels within reach and a dreamlike us
    I take in every single detail deep in my eyes

    La la la la la la
    La la la la la la la la
    La la la
    Just two of us

    Sunday for, Sunday for us
    It doesn't get better than this
    Our own kind of driving</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-together"><strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
    Closer (Ooh)
    너를 알고 싶어 깊은 맘의 끝까지
    Slow down (Slow down)
    너를 되감으며 난 네 거울이 되지
    네 움직임에
    난 매료돼
    너의 말투의 특징, 숨 쉬는 timing
    까지 같았으면 해

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
    더 나란히 발을 맞춰, 발을 맞춰
    맞닿은 손끝으론 너를 읽어

    <strong>[Chorus]</strong>
    I wanna dance with you, hold hands with you
    마주 댄 심장 위로 너와 함께 추는 춤
    오롯이 너에게 날 나에게 널 맡긴 후

    맞댄 뺨에
    두 심장의 떨림은 하나가 돼
    둘만의 무도회
    눈부신 moonlight
    영원히 기억될
    Starry night

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
    나와 함께 발을 맞춰, 발을 맞춰
    너조차 몰랐던 널 허락해 줘

    <strong>[Chorus]</strong>
    I wanna dance with you, hold hands with you
    혼자선 출 수 없는 달콤한 이 긴긴 춤 (Yeah)

    I was immature, making those wishes

    Now even for the smallest things,
    I'll leave half empty for you
    Take my hand,
    Now it feels like I've finally grown, by just one span
    You can take my half
    What I truly want,
    I won't be confused anymore

    These small, timid shoulders 
    Become a dam for your tears

    Now even for the smallest things,
    I'll leave half empty for you
    Fill my heart,
    The deep scars in my heart begin to heal
    You can take my half

    <h2>Bird Of Night</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-together">This solo song emphasizes Taehyun's emotional voice. Taehyun participates in writing and composing the lyrics, highlighting the vocalist's capabilities. It is a fairytale-like R&B song with a lyrical introduction that begins with a piano performance, a simple rhythm, and a synthesizer sound. Listening to the calm instrumental performance reminds me of a bird flying in the leisurely night sky, and Taehyun's delicate emotions explode in the chorus part, showing a different charm than before. The message that the night when you can't sleep due to anxiety is also a necessary time to move on to tomorrow conveys empathy and comfort to many people.</p>

    모두 잠든 깊은 밤이
    말을 걸어 와 잠들 수 없는 밤
    째깍대는 시계 소리
    도시의 소음만 점점 커져 가
    쌓여 가는 선택 사이
    불안함 속에 무거워진 어깨
    어른이 된단 건 뭘까? Yeah
    전부 흐려져 가

    흔들리지 않을 저 별빛은

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-together">The deep night when everyone's asleep, speaks to me, 
    A sleepless night
    The ticking sound of the clock
    And the noise of the city only keeps getting louder

    Between the piling choices,
    My shoulders become heavy with anxiety
    What does growing up even mean?
    Everything becomes blurry

    Wings flapping towards the stars
    I pray that I reach you 
    The reason I'm awake
    Is to keep going forward towards the stars, with you

    I fly like a bird of night
    Under countless lights of worry
    This brilliant night, our night flight 
    Still unable to sleep, but

    Spread my wings like a bird of night
    Under the starlight of the sleeping city
    A quiet night, my own night flight 
    They all become tiny dots but

    The deeper the darkness, the brighter it shines 
    That unwavering starlight
    I know the reason for this moment
    We should let it go

    The names of uncertain feelings
    Each person's reason for being awake
    Whatever darkness this world holds
    Will someday glow

    Looking down at the city
    The flickering street lights
    Just like my own heart
    A stranger's worries
    I think of you within that 
    I wonder if you feel the same

    Wings flapping towards the stars
    I pray that I reach you 
    The reason I'm awake
    Is to keep going forward towards the stars, with you

    I fly like a bird of night
    Under countless lights of worry
    This brilliant night, our night flight 
    Still unable to sleep, but

    The deeper the darkness, the brighter it shines 
    That unwavering starlight
    I know the reason for this moment
    We should let it go

    The reason I think of you,
    Who is looking at the same stars in this darkness
    Whatever darkness this world holds
    Will someday glow</p>

    <h2>Song Of The Stars</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-together">A song in the Stadium Rock genre that encapsulates the narrative of
    TOMORROW X TOGETHER. It is a perfect song to sing and interact with the audience at the concert hall. It starts with an emotional acoustic guitar sound, and in the second half, the strong band sound and the members' voices combine to create a great resonance. In particular, emotional lyrics such as "You and I sing together to the voice of the stars" and "I thought I was alone in that starlight taking a nap" leave a lingering impression.</p>

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-together">Following the voice of the stars, 
    You and I sing along
    Lyrics of eternity to remember each other
    Song of the stars, the stars with you

    The starlight that has dozed off into a nap
    I thought I was alone
    The world had no hope and I wondered who would even remember me
    In that moment, I heard my name being called for the first time

    The tears we shed together,
    The spell that was formed from them
    "Even if we part ways, let's meet here again" 
    Do you still remember the promise we made intertwining our pinky fingers?
    I can see

    Following the voice of the stars, 
    You and I sing along
    Lyrics of eternity to remember each other
    Song of the stars, the stars with you

    My name, Your name 
    Our names
    Song of the stars, the stars with you

    Again, we're at the start line 
    Shining on us, the starlight
    The tears we shed for each other, and the warmth passed between us
    When we sing this song, we'll always be next to the stars (next to each other)

    Remember

    Following the voice of the stars, 
    You and I sing along
    Lyrics of eternity to remember each other
    Song of the stars, the stars with you

    My name, Your name 
    Our names
    Song of the stars, the stars with you

    Under the stars
    Under the stars
    Under the stars

    Song of the stars, the stars with you
    Hope it lasts forever
    Song of the stars
    Our names

    The reason we're together</p>
