        <p>Gen Z's 'it' boys TOMORROW X TOGETHER continue their journey through the newest EP, minisode 2: Thursday's Child.
        In minisode 2: Thursday's Child, the experience of a first breakup strikes as a powerful storm mixed with denial, dejection, anger, and loss. Our protagonist fully indulges in and expresses each of these emotions as they come, until he is finally able to accept that his once treasured relationship has come to an end. Moving from adolescence to adulthood, the boy comes to better understand both himself and the world around him. Then, a question arises: on what path of growth will his feet lead him next?
        Minisode 2: Thursday's Child is a post-farewell recollection with five tracks total: “Good Boy Gone Bad,” “Trust Fund Baby,” “Opening Sequence,” and TOMORROW X TOGETHER's first two unit tracks, “Lonely Boy” and “Thursday's Child Has Far To Go.” The members have made creative contributions to all tracks in the EP.<br>

    <h2>OPENING SEQUENCE</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-minisode_2">It is an alternative R&B genre that compares the moment of parting for the first time to the 'opening sequence' of a movie that unfolds in flashback. 
        Like the lyrics "Countless memories fade and dissolve" and "Someone stops for a while, this opening sequence, no", the image of a boy who is tormented by the endless cycle of thoughts after a breakup is depicted on a delicate and sophisticated melody. 
        Taehyun and Hueningkai participated in the lyrics.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-minisode_2"><strong>[Intro: Taehyun]</strong>
    Yeah
    Ooh, ooh-ooh
    Ah-ah-ah-ah

    <strong>[Verse 1: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    헤어짐부터 반대로 흐르는 화면
    너와 내가 끝난 장면에서 영환 시작돼
    널 따라 걷는 이별의 build-up
    사건을 되감는 opening sequence (Ah, ah, ah)
    익숙한 이 pain

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Soobin, Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    기억 속의 네가 보여
    Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
    Take one more chance on me, chance on me, chance on me
    I'm bleeding painfully, painfully, painfully
    빛바랜 필름 속 너 나를 지운 네 시선
    Stay for me, stay for me, stay for me
    I can't get used to it, used to it, used to it
    반복돼 잔인하게 견딜 수가 없게
    I cry-y-y-y-y-y, ooh, yeah

    <strong>[Verse 2: Beomgyu, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Why'd you laugh?
    보여, 미소 짓는 너의 환영
    뒷걸음질 치는 달력은
    날 더 미치게 해 (해)
    수많은 추억이 fade and dissolve
    누가 좀 멈춰 이 opening sequence, no
    It's running through my head

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin & Beomgyu, Beomgyu]</strong>
    이제서야 난 깨달았어
    그림자 속 많은 복선들 (복선들)
    너와 약속한 세계의 끝 (Yeah)
    "That's so cliché"

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Soobin, Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    기억 속의 네가 보여
    Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
    Take one more chance on me (Chance on me), chance on me, chance on me
    I'm bleeding painfully, painfully, painfully
    빛바랜 필름 속 너 나를 지운 네 시선
    Stay for me, stay for me, stay for me
    I can't get used to it, used to it, used to it
    반복돼 잔인하게 견딜 수가 없게
    I cry-y-y-y-y, ooh, yeah-yeah
    Ooh, oh
    Oh, yeah
    Oh, yeah

    <strong>[Outro: Taehyun, Soobin, Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    뭣도 할 수 없어 그저
    Blame on me, blame on me, blame on me
    너와 내 tragedy, tragedy, tragedy
    가득해 슬픔이 슬픔이 슬픔이
    날 가둬버린 이 scene
    영원 같은 그 sequence
    Stay for me, stay for me, stay for me
    I can't get used to it, used to it, used to it
    반복돼 잔인하게 견딜 수가 없게
    I cry-ry-ry-ry-ry-ry, ooh, yeah</p>

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-minisode_2">The screen has been playing in reverse from the moment we broke up
    The movie begins from the scene where you and I ended
    You're walking away, the build-up of this break up
    The opening sequence rewinds the incident
    Ah, this familiar pain

    I can see you in my memories
    Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
    Take one more chance on me, chance on me, chance on me
    I'm bleeding painfully, painfully, painfully
    You in the faded picture
    And your gaze that erased me
    Stay for me, stay for me, stay for me
    I can't get used to it, used to it, used to it
    It repeats brutally, I can't get through it
    I cry

    Why'd you laugh?
    I can see it, your ghost that's smiling at me
    The calendar that's taking a step backwards
    It's driving me crazy
    So many memories, fade and dissolve
    Somebody please stop this opening sequence, no
    It's running through my head

    It's just hitting me now,
    All the plots that were hidden in the shadows
    You and the promised end of the world
    "That's so cliché."

    I can see you in my memories
    Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
    Take one more chance on me, chance on me, chance on me
    I'm bleeding painfully, painfully, painfully
    You in the faded picture
    And your gaze that erased me
    Stay for me, stay for me, stay for me
    I can't get used to it, used to it, used to it
    It repeats brutally, I can't get through it
    I cry

    I can't do anything anyway,
    Blame on me, blame on me, blame on me
    The tragedy tragedy tragedy of you and I
    I'm filled with sadness sadness sadness
    This scene has me trapped
    This sequence feels like an eternity
    Stay for me, stay for me, stay for me
    I can't get used to it, used to it, used to it
    It repeats brutally, I can't get through it
    I cry</p>

    <h2>GOOD BOY GONE BAD</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-minisode_2">This song is a hardcore hip-hop genre song with a rock sound, and the intuitive and impactful melody captures the story of an innocent boy who is overwhelmed by feelings of anger and loss after his first love, which seemed like it would last forever, is broken. 
        Unlike the emotional mood of longing for a past love, it directly expresses the rough and dark transformation (blackening) of a good and weak boy after experiencing a breakup, thereby capturing the image of Generation Z who is honest with his instincts and raising consensus. 
        The Federal Reserve participated in rap making and maximized its dark and powerful energy.</p>

    <p class="lyrics-minisode_2"><strong>[Intro: All]</strong>
    Woah-woah
    Woah-woah, oh
    Woah-woah
    Woah-woah, oh

    <strong>[Verse 1: Beomgyu, Taehyun, Huening Kai, All]</strong>
    영원이란 말 위에 못질해 관뚜껑을 덮어
    넌 약해빠졌었던 날 완전히 바꿔놨어
    난 네가 되고 싶어 종일 거울 앞에 서서
    얼굴을 할퀴어, 심장을 삼켜
    (Woah-woah, oh)
    나를 버리던 너에게
    꼬릴 흔들었던 내 past
    I just killed me with all that stress
    이젠 다 상관없어 난
    (Woah-woah, woah-woah, oh)

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, All, Beomgyu]</strong>
    부서진 기분은 왠지
    나쁘지 않아 (Woah-woah, woah-woah, oh)
    한심했던 날들보다
    Watch, watch, gotta watch, watch me, yeah
    난 날 죽여 죽여놔

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Huening Kai]</strong>
    다 내다 버려, good boys gone bad
    다 버려, good boys gone bad
    널 사랑했던, good boys gone bad
    Now, 더 날 부숴 부숴놔
    내 가슴팍엔 흉터 gone bad
    심장을 긋고 gone dead
    네가 알던 that good boy's gone bad
    Now, 난 날 죽여 죽여놔

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Soobin, Beomgyu]</strong>
    (Good boy gone bad)
    Good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad
    Good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad
    (Good boy gone bad)
    Good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad
    Good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad

    <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun, Huening Kai, All, Taehyun]</strong>
    네 안의 소년을 지워낸 다음 (Yeah)
    망가진 내 모습을 채워놔
    난 마치 zombie처럼 dead alive
    사랑의 무덤 위에 태어나
    (Woah-woah, oh)
    솔직히 더 맘에 드네
    완전히 달라진 내 face
    I just killed me with all that pain
    이젠 다 상관없어 난 (Hey)
    (Woah-woah, woah-woah, oh)

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, All, Beomgyu]</strong>
    눈감은 절망의 밤은
    왠지 달콤해 (Woah-woah, woah-woah, oh)
    오히려 자유로워 난
    Watch, watch, gotta watch, watch me, yeah
    난 날 죽여 죽여놔

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Taehyun, Soobin]</strong>
    다 내다 버려, good boys gone bad
    다 버려, good boys gone bad (Gone bad)
    널 사랑했던, good boys gone bad (Yeah, yeah)
    Now, 더 날 부숴 부숴놔

    심장을 긋고 gone dead
    네가 알던 that good boy's gone bad (Yeah, yeah)
    Now, 난 날 죽여 죽여놔
    Good boy gone bad

    <strong>[Bridge: Huening Kai, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    네 자국을 뜯어낸 맘
    너의 흔적들이 흘러나와
    Love is a lie, I loved that lie
    태워버려, burn it out
    집어치워 love 개나 줘 forever
    피 대신 흘러 monochrome diamonds
    Killed it, I killed it myself
    곤두박질 부러진 날개로
    추락해도 아프지 않아 anymore (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
    I like being bad

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Yeonjun, Taehyun]</strong>
    다 내다 버려, good boys gone bad (Yeah)
    다 버려, good boys gone bad (Oh)
    널 사랑했던, good boys gone bad (Oh, yeah)
    Now, 더 날 부숴 부숴놔
    내 가슴팍엔 흉터 gone bad (Yeah)
    심장을 긋고 gone dead (Gone dead)
    네가 알던 that good boy's gone bad (That good boy's gone bad)
    Now, 난 날 죽여 죽여놔

    <p class="lyrics-minisode_2">Woah-woah
    Woah-woah, oh
    Woah-woah
    Woah-woah, oh

    Put that nail in the coffin over the word forever
    You completely changed me when I was fragile
    I spent hours in front of the mirror wanting to become you
    Scratching my face, swallowing my heart
    You kept abandoning me
    My tail wagged at you, that's my past
    i just killed me with all that stress
    I don't care about anything anymore

    This feeling of being broken isn't so bad
    Better than those hopeless days
    watch watch gotta watch watch me yeah
    (I'm going to kill that me, kill me)

    Throw it all away, good boys gone bad
    Throw it all away, good boys gone bad
    The good boys that loved you gone bad
    now
    (Break me more, just break me)
    The scar on my chest gone bad
    Slash my heart then, gone dead
    The good boys that you knew gone bad
    now
    (I'm going to kill that me, kill me)

    Good boy gone bad
    (Good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad)
    Good boy gone bad
    (Good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad)

    Erase that boy inside of you
    Then fill it up with the wreck that I've become
    I'm like a zombie, dead alive
    Born on the tomb of love
    I honestly like it better now
    This completely altered face of mine
    I just killed me with all that pain
    I don't care about anything anymore

    For some reason, this close-eyed night of despair is sweet to me
    I feel free now
    watch watch gotta watch watch me yeah
    (I'm going to kill that me, kill me)

    Throw it all away, good boys gone bad
    Throw it all away, good boys gone bad
    The good boys that loved you gone bad

    Slash my heart then, gone dead
    The good boys that you knew gone bad
    now
    (I'm going to kill that me, kill me)
    Good boy gone bad

    Gouge you out from my heart
    Bleeding out the traces of you
    Love is a lie, I loved that lie
    Burn it, just burn it out
    Get rid of the love, give that 'forever' to the dogs or something
    I bleed monochrome diamonds instead of blood
    Killed it I killed it myself
    even if i crash down head first with broken wings, it doesn’t hurt anymore
    I like being bad

    Throw it all away, good boys gone bad
    Throw it all away, good boys gone bad
    The good boys that loved you gone bad
    now
    (Break me more, just break me)

        -re: lyric "towards 'forever', I'm flying" from LO$ER=LO&#9825;ER <br>
        -"개나 줘" (give it to the dogs) actually means "I don't need it anymore so even if you give it to me, I won't take it from you" <br>

    <strong>LINE 2:</strong> "i bleed monochrome diamonds instead of blood, killed it, I killed it myself" <br>
        -blood flows through and from the heart, but since he's heartbroken, he's angry and he doesn't care if he seems heartless<br>
        -"killed it, I killed it myself" means "I killed my old self, myself" <br>
        -diamond is the hardest material on Earth, in saying that he no longer bleeds blood but instead bleeds diamonds, he's implying that he's turning cold and heartless <br>
        -"monochrome" is often used to describe something that has no life or something that is not exiting. <br>

    <p class="modal-note-minisode_2">
    <strong>LINE 3:</strong> "even if I crash down head first with broken wings, it doesn't hurt anymore" <br>
        lyric from lo$er=lo♡er: “jump off from this highway, these wings that broke while being spread out,no matter how much i try, i crash.
        (but) if I'm with you, even crashing is beautiful
        on the other side of the sky, I'll gladly sink down” <br> <br>

        @TXTtranslation'd like to think that this is a heavy reference to the fall of icarus. 

        Icarus was the son of a craftsman, daedalus. daedalus created a labyrinth so that the minator (half human, half bull-monster) would never escape but the king that ordered daedalus to do so, said that daedalus and icarus would be locked in the tower to keep the existence of the labyrinth a secret. Daedalus glued several feathers of birds together with wax to make wings for icarus and himself. <br> <br>

        He warned icarus to not fly too close to the sun because the wax would melt off and he'd crash into the sea. He also warned him to not fly too close to the sea because the spray from the sea water would weigh his wings down, also leading to him eventually crashing. <br> <br>

        Icarus felt a lot of excitement and thrill from flying for the first time and forgot about the warnings. He flew too high and close to the sun and he crashed into the sea and drowned in it. <br> <br>

        Back to the song, like icarus, he was also looking for freedom: the wings that were already broken felt like they didn't matter because the first love felt so exciting that he thought everything was beautiful, even crashing into the sea, as long as he's with his lover.

        However, just like icarus, he couldn't find the balance between two things & after the heartbreak that this person caused him, even crashing head-first didn't hurt him anymore.<br> <br>

        In astronomy, icarus is an asteroid whose orbit brings it closer to the sun than any other known orbit.개나 줘" (give it to the dogs) actually means "I don't need it anymore so even if you give it to me, I won't take it from you"

    <h2>TRUST FUND BABY</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-minisode_2">A pop ballad genre song with a touch of indie pop. It captures the boy's sense of deprivation, resignation, and cynicism towards the world when he sees 'Trust Fund Baby' (gold spoon), which he thinks he can escape from reality and protect his love with money, but fails in the end, and unlike himself, he keeps both his dreams and love. 
        The song is impressive with its sharp lyrics about 'a world where you can't love without money' and the lyrical melody that contrasts with it, and Taehyun and Yeonjun participated in writing the lyrics. 
        After the boy who shouted "Lover with a $ dollar sign" in his previous work "LO$ER=LO♡ER", after facing reality, the change of heart to say "Lover with no $ dollar sign" is a point to note.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-minisode_2"><strong>[Intro: All]</strong>
    Hah

    <strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Taehyun]</strong>
    빛이 나는 spoon 내게는 남 얘기
    누군가의 꿈 이미 다 가진
    그들의 삶 속엔 없는 game over
    원하면 뭐든 지킬 수 있겠지
    나완 다르니 그게 한 평의 방이 됐든
    꿈이 됐든 사랑이든 (Oh)

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
    I can't be a lover
    이 세계의 charge
    A bit too much
    I might lose again 이 game

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Huening Kai, Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    I'll never be a trust fund baby, no
    그 삶이 내 거면 왜 안 되는 걸까?
    빈 wallet 그보다 더 비어버린 마음의 이름은
    Lover with no dollar sign
    I'll never be a trust fund baby, no
    I wish everything's a lie, ah
    Hm-hm
    Ah-ah-ah-ah

    <strong>[Verse 2: Beomgyu, Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
    훔친 hundred bands
    더 비참해질 뿐 주인은 못 돼
    패배자를 위한 낙원 따윈
    구원 따윈 물론 없어
    Yeah, I know, I know I'm not like them
    더하고 곱해봐도 잘 안돼
    그 어떤 수도 0인 내겐
    I'm nothing 살 수 없는 걸

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Yeonjun, Soobin, Beomgyu]</strong>
    I'll never be a trust fund baby, no
    그 삶이 내 거면 왜 안 되는 걸까?
    빈 wallet 그보다 더 비어버린 마음의 이름은
    Lover with no dollar sign
    I'll never be a trust fund baby, no
    I wish everything's a lie, ah
    Hm-hm
    Ah-ah-ah-ah

    <strong>[Outro: Taehyun]</strong>
    I'll never be a trust fund baby, no
    I wish everything's a lie</p>

    <p class="lyrics-minisode_2">The shining silver spoon is just somebody else's story to me
    They already living somebody else's dream
    There's no 'game over' in their lives
    If they want to, they can protect anything
    They're different to me so it could just be a room, their dream or love, oh

    I can't be a lover,
    The charge of the world is a bit too much
    I might lose again, this game

    I'll never be a trust fund baby, no
    Why can't that life ever be mine?
    My heart that's become emptier than my wallet is named
    Lover with no $ dollar sign
    I'll never be a trust fund baby, no
    I wish everything's a lie

    The stolen hunnit bands,
    It'll only make me more miserable
    I can never become the owner
    There's no such thing as paradise for a loser,
    There is definitely no salvation
    Yeah, I know I know I'm not like them
    It won't work out even if I add or multiply the numbers
    No matter what the number is, I'll still be a 0
    I'm nothing, and you can't buy it

    I'll never be a trust fund baby, no
    Why can't that life ever be mine?
    My heart that's become emptier than my wallet is named
    Lover with no $ dollar sign

    I'll never be a trust fund baby, no
    I wish everything's a lie</p>

    <h2>LONELY BOY (The tattoo on my ring finger)</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-minisode_2">This is a unit song by Yeonjun and Hueningkai, and is a contemporary R&B genre. It depicts the sense of loss, regret, and resignation that a boy who experienced his first breakup feels when he looks at the couple's tattoo left on his fourth finger. 
        It was a sign of special love, but after the breakup, it continued to stimulate painful emotions. 
        Guitar riffs and in a melancholic mood, Huening Kai's mournful vocals and Yeonjun's emo sensibility singing rap were combined. Hueningkai participated in the lyrics.</p>

    <p class="lyrics-minisode_2"><strong>[Intro: Huening Kai]</strong>
    Lonely boy stayin' lonely
    미련뿐인 이별이
    Lonely boy stayin' lonely
    She ain't my one and only

    <strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun]</strong>
    괜히 만지작거려 나만 홀로 남아 여기
    없어 너는 gone 남긴 흔적마저 lonely
    날카로운 바늘로 찍어 남긴 건 (Ayy)
    손가락뿐만이 아냐 내 마음까지도
    깊 찔러 날 마구
    살갗을 파고든 너의 말은 cruel
    반지를 대신해 자리한 자국
    네 번째 손가락 위 너란 타투, yeah

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai]</strong>
    Lonely boy stayin' lonely
    바뀌지 않을 story
    Lonely boy stayin' lonely
    미련뿐인 이별이

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    싫어 이젠 I don't need it
    낫지 않을 네 흔적이
    Standing here alone
    Lonely boy stayin' lonely (Stayin' lonely)
    She ain't my one and only, one and only

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Huening Kai]</strong>
    Stayin' lonely, stayin' lonely, stayin' lonely
    Lonely, stayin' lonely
    Stayin' lonely, stayin' lonely

    <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun]</strong>
    손깍지 끼면 하나가 됐던
    외롭게 남겨진 반쪽짜리 star
    Tell me about the meaning 없어 그딴 거
    잃어버린 의미 돼버린 낙서
    Yeah, I was stupid
    왜 그랬을까 그땐 (Ooh)
    이젠 추억도 못 해 (Ooh)
    내버려 둘 수밖에 (Ooh)

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai]</strong>
    Lonely boy stayin' lonely
    네 곁에 머문 memories (Memories)
    Lonely boy stayin' lonely (Yeah-eh)
    남겨진 건 이별인

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai]</strong>
    싫어 이젠 I don't need it
    낫지 않을 네 흔적이
    Standing here alone
    Lonely boy stayin' lonely
    She ain't my one and only, one and only

    <p class="lyrics-minisode_2">Lonely boy stayin' lonely
    The only thing lingering is our breakup
    Lonely boy stayin' lonely
    She ain't my one and only

    I needless fidget with it, I'm the only one left alone here
    You're not here, you're gone
    Even the left over traces are lonely
    The thing carved with a sharp needle is all that's left
    Not only on my finger, but also on my heart
    Pierce me deeply
    Your cruel words penetrate through my skin
    Now there's a mark that has replaced the ring
    There's a tattoo called 'you' on my ring finger

    Lonely boy stayin' lonely
    The story that will never change
    Lonely boy stayin' lonely
    The only thing lingering is our breakup

    I hate it now, I don't need it
    Your traces are not going to heal
    Standing here alone
    Lonely boy stayin' lonely
    She ain't my one and only, one and only

    Stayin' lonely, stayin' lonely, stayin' lonely
    Lonely, stayin' lonely, stayin' lonely, stayin' lonely

    We became one when we held hands,
    Leaving the other half of the star all alone
    Tell me about the meaning, it isn't there
    It's just become a scribble with a lost meaning
    Yeah I was stupid
    Why was I like that back then?
    I can't even remember it anymore
    I can't do anything but throw it away

    Lonely boy stayin' lonely
    All the memories remain by your side
    Lonely boy stayin' lonely
    All that's left is our farewell

    I hate it now, I don't need it
    Your traces are not going to heal
    Standing here alone
    Lonely boy stayin' lonely
    She ain't my one and only, one and only

    <h2>THURSDAY'S CHILD HAS FAR TO GO</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-minisode_2">This unit song by Soobin, Beomgyu, and Taehyun is a refreshing and retro synth-pop song. 
        Some of Mother Goose's oral nursery rhymes "Thursday's Child Has Far To Go" and the hashtag "#breakup_glowup", which means taking care of oneself to become a more attractive person instead of being discouraged and collapsing after a breakup, were borrowed as the main themes.
         By connecting the contradictory themes of oral nursery rhymes and TikTok hashtags, it captures the boy's will to overcome the sadness of separation and move forward on a new path with a positive heart. The catchy retro synth sound, the running beat, and the cool vocals of the three members are combined. 
        Taehyun participated in the composition and lyrics, while Beomgyu participated in producing, adding meaning.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-minisode_2"><strong>[Chorus: Taehyun]</strong>
    Born to be a Thursday's child
    가야 할 길이 많은 아이
    나를 기다릴 날들과
    발을 맞추러 go (Woah-oh-oh, woah)
    Born to be a Thursday's child
    눈물 위에서 피는 smile
    다시 펼쳐질 순간과
    눈을 맞추러 go

    <strong>[Verse 1: Beomgyu, Soobin]</strong>
    헤어지기 좋은 날
    월요일은 아닐걸
    주말이 너무 멀잖아
    엉망이 될걸 seven days
    It's Thursday, 목요일에 헤어져
    금요일엔 실컷 울어버리고
    토요일 밤에 기운을 내
    일요일 하루 더 있잖아

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Taehyun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    떠나온 슬픔의 너머엔
    설렘만 가득 채워지게
    목요일의 아이라는 운명이 날
    날 다시 걷게 하네 feelin' so good

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun]</strong>
    Born to be a Thursday's child
    가야 할 길이 많은 아이
    나를 기다릴 날들과
    발을 맞추러 go (Woah-oh-oh, woah)
    Born to be a Thursday's child
    눈물 위에서 피는 smile
    다시 펼쳐질 순간과
    눈을 맞추러 go (Woah-oh-oh)

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Soobin]</strong>
    다신 울지 않을래
    다신 울지 않을래
    다신 울지 않을래

    <strong>[Verse 2: Beomgyu]</strong>
    여기저기 눈에 띄어
    요즘 뜨는 trend가
    오늘의 hashtag breakup
    그 뒤에 붙여 glowup

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Beomgyu]</strong>
    길었던 눈물은 뒤로해
    걸어가 운명을 마주해
    목요일의 아이라는 낭만이 날
    날 다시 웃게 하네 feelin' so good

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun]</strong>
    Born to be a Thursday's child
    가야 할 길이 많은 아이
    나를 기다릴 날들과
    발을 맞추러 go (Woah-oh-oh, woah)
    Born to be a Thursday's child
    눈물 위에서 피는 smile
    다시 펼쳐질 순간과
    눈을 맞추러 go (Woah-oh-oh)

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Soobin]</strong>
    다신 울지 않을래

    <strong>[Bridge: Beomgyu, Taehyun, Soobin]</strong>
    괜찮은 것 같아 (같아)
    무너졌던 맘이 (맘이)
    후련한 것 같아
    다시 만난 목요일, it's okay
    온 길보다 험하겠지만
    예측불허의 our life
    온 길보다 더 멀겠지만
    멋진 날들이 기다려

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun]</strong>
    Born to be a Thursday's child
    이제부터가 시작이야
    나를 기다릴 날들과
    발을 맞추러 go (Woah-oh-oh, woah)
    Born to be a Thursday's child
    멀고 아득한 어딘가
    다시 펼쳐질 순간과
    눈을 맞추러 go (Woah-oh-oh)

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Taehyun]</strong>
    다신 울지 않을래 (Oh)
    다신 울지 않을래 (Oh, yeah)
    다신 울지 않을래</p>

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-minisode_2">Born to be a Thursday's child
    A child who has a long way to go
    Gonna go to match my footsteps
    With the days that await me
    Born to be a Thursday's child
    A smile that blossoms from my tears
    Gonna go look at the moments
    That will spread out again

    A good day to break up with someone
    Can't be Monday
    The weekend is too far
    The 7 days would be a disaster
    It's Thursday
    Break up with me on a Thursday
    I'll cry my heart out on Friday
    Gain some strength on Saturday night
    And then I still have Sunday

    On the other side of the sadness,
    I'll fill it up with only excitement
    My fate of being a Thursday's child,
    Makes it possible for me to walk this path again, feelin' so good

    Born to be a Thursday's child
    A child who has a long way to go
    Gonna go match my footsteps
    With the days that await me
    Born to be a Thursday's child
    A smile that blossoms from my tears
    Gonna go look at the moments
    That will spread out again

    I'm not going to cry again
    I'm not going to cry again
    I'm not going to cry again

    Something has been catching my eye lately,
    The trend that's popular these days
    Today's hashtag #breakup
    And then add a #glowup next to it

    Put the tears behind you
    Walk and face your destiny
    The romance of being a Thursday's child,
    Makes it possible for me to laugh again, feelin' so good

    Born to be a Thursday's child
    A child who has a long way to go
    Gonna go to match my footsteps
    With the days that await me
    Born to be a Thursday's child
    A smile that blossoms from my tears
    Gonna go look at the moments
    That will spread out again

    I'm not going to cry again

    I think I'm okay
    I think my crumbled heart
    Has been refreshed
    On the Thursday that comes again, it's okay
    It's going to be tougher than the path that we've already walked,
    It's unpredictable, our life
    It's going to be farther than the path that we've already walked
    I'm waiting for the good day

    Born to be a Thursday's child
    This is just the beginning
    Gonna go match my footsteps
    With the days that await me
    Born to be a Thursday's child
    Somewhere that's far and distant
    Gonna go look at the moments
    That will spread out again

    I'm not going to cry again
    I'm not going to cry again
    I'm not going to cry again</p>
