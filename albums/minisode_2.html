        <p>Gen Z's 'it' boys TOMORROW X TOGETHER continue their journey through the newest EP, minisode 2: Thursday's Child.
        In minisode 2: Thursday's Child, the experience of a first breakup strikes as a powerful storm mixed with denial, dejection, anger, and loss. Our protagonist fully indulges in and expresses each of these emotions as they come, until he is finally able to accept that his once treasured relationship has come to an end. Moving from adolescence to adulthood, the boy comes to better understand both himself and the world around him. Then, a question arises: on what path of growth will his feet lead him next?
        Minisode 2: Thursday's Child is a post-farewell recollection with five tracks total: “Good Boy Gone Bad,” “Trust Fund Baby,” “Opening Sequence,” and TOMORROW X TOGETHER's first two unit tracks, “Lonely Boy” and “Thursday's Child Has Far To Go.” The members have made creative contributions to all tracks in the EP.<br>

    <h2>OPENING SEQUENCE</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-minisode_2">It is an alternative R&B genre that compares the moment of parting for the first time to the 'opening sequence' of a movie that unfolds in flashback. 
        Like the lyrics "Countless memories fade and dissolve" and "Someone stops for a while, this opening sequence, no", the image of a boy who is tormented by the endless cycle of thoughts after a breakup is depicted on a delicate and sophisticated melody. 
        Taehyun and Hueningkai participated in the lyrics.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-minisode_2"><strong>[Intro: Taehyun]</strong>
    Yeah
    Ooh, ooh-ooh
    Ah-ah-ah-ah

    <strong>[Verse 1: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    헤어짐부터 반대로 흐르는 화면
    너와 내가 끝난 장면에서 영환 시작돼
    널 따라 걷는 이별의 build-up
    사건을 되감는 opening sequence (Ah, ah, ah)
    익숙한 이 pain

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Soobin, Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    기억 속의 네가 보여
    Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
    Take one more chance on me, chance on me, chance on me
    I'm bleeding painfully, painfully, painfully
    빛바랜 필름 속 너 나를 지운 네 시선
    Stay for me, stay for me, stay for me
    I can't get used to it, used to it, used to it
    반복돼 잔인하게 견딜 수가 없게
    I cry-y-y-y-y-y, ooh, yeah

    <strong>[Verse 2: Beomgyu, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Why'd you laugh?
    보여, 미소 짓는 너의 환영
    뒷걸음질 치는 달력은
    날 더 미치게 해 (해)
    수많은 추억이 fade and dissolve
    누가 좀 멈춰 이 opening sequence, no
    It's running through my head

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin & Beomgyu, Beomgyu]</strong>
    이제서야 난 깨달았어
    그림자 속 많은 복선들 (복선들)
    너와 약속한 세계의 끝 (Yeah)
    "That's so cliché"

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Soobin, Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    기억 속의 네가 보여
    Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
    Take one more chance on me (Chance on me), chance on me, chance on me
    I'm bleeding painfully, painfully, painfully
    빛바랜 필름 속 너 나를 지운 네 시선
    Stay for me, stay for me, stay for me
    I can't get used to it, used to it, used to it
    반복돼 잔인하게 견딜 수가 없게
    I cry-y-y-y-y, ooh, yeah-yeah
    Ooh, oh
    Oh, yeah
    Oh, yeah

    <strong>[Outro: Taehyun, Soobin, Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    뭣도 할 수 없어 그저
    Blame on me, blame on me, blame on me
    너와 내 tragedy, tragedy, tragedy
    가득해 슬픔이 슬픔이 슬픔이
    날 가둬버린 이 scene
    영원 같은 그 sequence
    Stay for me, stay for me, stay for me
    I can't get used to it, used to it, used to it
    반복돼 잔인하게 견딜 수가 없게
    I cry-ry-ry-ry-ry-ry, ooh, yeah</p>

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-minisode_2">The screen has been playing in reverse from the moment we broke up
    The movie begins from the scene where you and I ended
    You're walking away, the build-up of this break up
    The opening sequence rewinds the incident
    Ah, this familiar pain

    I can see you in my memories
    Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
    Take one more chance on me, chance on me, chance on me
    I'm bleeding painfully, painfully, painfully
    You in the faded picture
    And your gaze that erased me
    Stay for me, stay for me, stay for me
    I can't get used to it, used to it, used to it
    It repeats brutally, I can't get through it
    I cry

    Why'd you laugh?
    I can see it, your ghost that's smiling at me
    The calendar that's taking a step backwards
    It's driving me crazy
    So many memories, fade and dissolve
    Somebody please stop this opening sequence, no
    It's running through my head

    It's just hitting me now,
    All the plots that were hidden in the shadows
    You and the promised end of the world
    "That's so cliché."

    I can see you in my memories
    Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
    Take one more chance on me, chance on me, chance on me
    I'm bleeding painfully, painfully, painfully
    You in the faded picture
    And your gaze that erased me
    Stay for me, stay for me, stay for me
    I can't get used to it, used to it, used to it
    It repeats brutally, I can't get through it
    I cry

    I can't do anything anyway,
    Blame on me, blame on me, blame on me
    The tragedy tragedy tragedy of you and I
    I'm filled with sadness sadness sadness
    This scene has me trapped
    This sequence feels like an eternity
    Stay for me, stay for me, stay for me
    I can't get used to it, used to it, used to it
    It repeats brutally, I can't get through it
    I cry</p>

    <h2>GOOD BOY GONE BAD</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-minisode_2">This song is a hardcore hip-hop genre song with a rock sound, and the intuitive and impactful melody captures the story of an innocent boy who is overwhelmed by feelings of anger and loss after his first love, which seemed like it would last forever, is broken. 
        Unlike the emotional mood of longing for a past love, it directly expresses the rough and dark transformation (blackening) of a good and weak boy after experiencing a breakup, thereby capturing the image of Generation Z who is honest with his instincts and raising consensus. 
        The Federal Reserve participated in rap making and maximized its dark and powerful energy.</p>

    <p class="lyrics-minisode_2"><strong>[Intro: All]</strong>
    Woah-woah
    Woah-woah, oh
    Woah-woah
    Woah-woah, oh

    <strong>[Verse 1: Beomgyu, Taehyun, Huening Kai, All]</strong>
    영원이란 말 위에 못질해 관뚜껑을 덮어
    넌 약해빠졌었던 날 완전히 바꿔놨어
    난 네가 되고 싶어 종일 거울 앞에 서서
    얼굴을 할퀴어, 심장을 삼켜
    (Woah-woah, oh)
    나를 버리던 너에게
    꼬릴 흔들었던 내 past
    I just killed me with all that stress
    이젠 다 상관없어 난
    (Woah-woah, woah-woah, oh)

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, All, Beomgyu]</strong>
    부서진 기분은 왠지
    나쁘지 않아 (Woah-woah, woah-woah, oh)
    한심했던 날들보다
    Watch, watch, gotta watch, watch me, yeah
    난 날 죽여 죽여놔


    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Huening Kai]</strong>
    다 내다 버려, good boys gone bad
    다 버려, good boys gone bad
    널 사랑했던, good boys gone bad
    Now, 더 날 부숴 부숴놔
    내 가슴팍엔 흉터 gone bad
    심장을 긋고 gone dead
    네가 알던 that good boy's gone bad
    Now, 난 날 죽여 죽여놔

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Soobin, Beomgyu]</strong>
    (Good boy gone bad)
    Good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad
    Good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad
    (Good boy gone bad)
    Good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad
    Good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad

    <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun, Huening Kai, All, Taehyun]</strong>
    네 안의 소년을 지워낸 다음 (Yeah)
    망가진 내 모습을 채워놔
    난 마치 zombie처럼 dead alive
    사랑의 무덤 위에 태어나
    (Woah-woah, oh)
    솔직히 더 맘에 드네
    완전히 달라진 내 face
    I just killed me with all that pain
    이젠 다 상관없어 난 (Hey)
    (Woah-woah, woah-woah, oh)

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, All, Beomgyu]</strong>
    눈감은 절망의 밤은
    왠지 달콤해 (Woah-woah, woah-woah, oh)
    오히려 자유로워 난
    Watch, watch, gotta watch, watch me, yeah
    난 날 죽여 죽여놔

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Taehyun, Soobin]</strong>
    다 내다 버려, good boys gone bad
    다 버려, good boys gone bad (Gone bad)
    널 사랑했던, good boys gone bad (Yeah, yeah)
    Now, 더 날 부숴 부숴놔

    심장을 긋고 gone dead
    네가 알던 that good boy's gone bad (Yeah, yeah)
    Now, 난 날 죽여 죽여놔
    Good boy gone bad

    <strong>[Bridge: Huening Kai, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    네 자국을 뜯어낸 맘
    너의 흔적들이 흘러나와
    Love is a lie, I loved that lie
    태워버려, burn it out
    집어치워 love 개나 줘 forever
    피 대신 흘러 monochrome diamonds
    Killed it, I killed it myself
    곤두박질 부러진 날개로
    추락해도 아프지 않아 anymore (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
    I like being bad

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Yeonjun, Taehyun]</strong>
    다 내다 버려, good boys gone bad (Yeah)
    다 버려, good boys gone bad (Oh)
    널 사랑했던, good boys gone bad (Oh, yeah)
    Now, 더 날 부숴 부숴놔
    내 가슴팍엔 흉터 gone bad (Yeah)
    심장을 긋고 gone dead (Gone dead)
    네가 알던 that good boy's gone bad (That good boy's gone bad)
    Now, 난 날 죽여 죽여놔

    <p class="lyrics-minisode_2">Woah-woah
    Woah-woah, oh
    Woah-woah
    Woah-woah, oh

    Put that nail in the coffin over the word forever
    You completely changed me when I was fragile
    I spent hours in front of the mirror wanting to become you
    Scratching my face, swallowing my heart
    You kept abandoning me
    My tail wagged at you, that's my past
    i just killed me with all that stress
    I don't care about anything anymore

    This feeling of being broken isn't so bad
    Better than those hopeless days
    watch watch gotta watch watch me yeah
    (I'm going to kill that me, kill me)

    Throw it all away, good boys gone bad
    Throw it all away, good boys gone bad
    The good boys that loved you gone bad
    now
    (Break me more, just break me)
    The scar on my chest gone bad
    Slash my heart then, gone dead
    The good boys that you knew gone bad
    now
    (I'm going to kill that me, kill me)

    Good boy gone bad
    (Good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad)
    Good boy gone bad
    (Good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad, good boy gone bad)

    Erase that boy inside of you
    Then fill it up with the wreck that I've become
    I'm like a zombie, dead alive
    Born on the tomb of love
    I honestly like it better now
    This completely altered face of mine
    I just killed me with all that pain
    I don't care about anything anymore

    For some reason, this close-eyed night of despair is sweet to me
    I feel free now
    watch watch gotta watch watch me yeah
    (I'm going to kill that me, kill me)

    Throw it all away, good boys gone bad
    Throw it all away, good boys gone bad
    The good boys that loved you gone bad

    Slash my heart then, gone dead
    The good boys that you knew gone bad
    now
    (I'm going to kill that me, kill me)
    Good boy gone bad

    Gouge you out from my heart
    Bleeding out the traces of you
    Love is a lie, I loved that lie
    Burn it, just burn it out
    Get rid of the love, give that 'forever' to the dogs or something
    I bleed monochrome diamonds instead of blood
    Killed it I killed it myself
    even if i crash down head first with broken wings, it doesn’t hurt anymore
    I like being bad

    Throw it all away, good boys gone bad
    Throw it all away, good boys gone bad
    The good boys that loved you gone bad
    now
    (Break me more, just break me)

        -re: lyric "towards 'forever', I'm flying" from LO$ER=LO&#9825;ER <br>
        -"개나 줘" (give it to the dogs) actually means "I don't need it anymore so even if you give it to me, I won't take it from you" <br>

    <strong>LINE 2:</strong> "i bleed monochrome diamonds instead of blood, killed it, I killed it myself" <br>
        -blood flows through and from the heart, but since he's heartbroken, he's angry and he doesn't care if he seems heartless<br>
        -"killed it, I killed it myself" means "I killed my old self, myself" <br>
        -diamond is the hardest material on Earth, in saying that he no longer bleeds blood but instead bleeds diamonds, he's implying that he's turning cold and heartless <br>
        -"monochrome" is often used to describe something that has no life or something that is not exiting. <br>

    <p class="modal-note-minisode_2">
    <strong>LINE 3:</strong> "even if I crash down head first with broken wings, it doesn't hurt anymore" <br>
        lyric from lo$er=lo♡er: “jump off from this highway, these wings that broke while being spread out,no matter how much i try, i crash.
        (but) if I'm with you, even crashing is beautiful
        on the other side of the sky, I'll gladly sink down” <br> <br>

        @TXTtranslation'd like to think that this is a heavy reference to the fall of icarus. 

        Icarus was the son of a craftsman, daedalus. daedalus created a labyrinth so that the minator (half human, half bull-monster) would never escape but the king that ordered daedalus to do so, said that daedalus and icarus would be locked in the tower to keep the existence of the labyrinth a secret. Daedalus glued several feathers of birds together with wax to make wings for icarus and himself. <br> <br>

        He warned icarus to not fly too close to the sun because the wax would melt off and he'd crash into the sea. He also warned him to not fly too close to the sea because the spray from the sea water would weigh his wings down, also leading to him eventually crashing. <br> <br>

        Icarus felt a lot of excitement and thrill from flying for the first time and forgot about the warnings. He flew too high and close to the sun and he crashed into the sea and drowned in it. <br> <br>

        Back to the song, like icarus, he was also looking for freedom: the wings that were already broken felt like they didn't matter because the first love felt so exciting that he thought everything was beautiful, even crashing into the sea, as long as he's with his lover.

        However, just like icarus, he couldn't find the balance between two things & after the heartbreak that this person caused him, even crashing head-first didn't hurt him anymore.<br> <br>

        In astronomy, icarus is an asteroid whose orbit brings it closer to the sun than any other known orbit.개나 줘" (give it to the dogs) actually means "I don't need it anymore so even if you give it to me, I won't take it from you"
