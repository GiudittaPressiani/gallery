                <h2>Drama</h2>
                <p class="modal-songs-description-eternity">It is a song in the funk pop genre that combines funky guitar rhythms, catchy piano, and charming brass. 
                  It tells the story that he accidentally became friends with 'you', who was the main character at school, and spent the drama-like time he had dreamed of, but 'you' was the main character and 'I' was an extra, and there was no drama for 'me'. 
                  As the title suggests, a story like this makes you feel like you're watching a drama. The upbeat rhythm, colorful instrument sounds, and catchy melodic lines that contrast with the lyrics captivate the ears.

                <p class="lyrics-eternity"><strong>[Verse 1: Beomgyu, Taehyun, Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
                  저 환호성 난 매일 그 뒤 yeah
                  쿨한 미소는 너의 주무기
                  처음 만났던 운동장의 court
                  나도 주인공만 같던 movie scene
                  네 패스 하나에 바로 나도 그 scene 안에
                  Spotlight 불빛 아래 내 자리
                  날 향해 던져준 너의 다정한 그 말에
                  나도 한순간에 주연이

                  <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
                  Oh oh, 내디뎌 한발
                  Oh oh, give me a highlight
                  Oh oh, 꿈꿔온 drama
                  Time to show my play

                  스티커 사진 속 넌 주인님
                  아이구 죄송, 넘은 내 선
                  엑스트라 1은 오늘도 통편집
                  함께 하고 있지만 마음이 이상해
                  자꾸 CG같애 내 몸이

                  작고 시시한 내 결말이

                  <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
                  Oh oh, 잘 가 내 망상
                  Oh oh, 다가온 bye bye
                  Oh oh, 널 위한 drama

                <p class="lyrics-eternity">Those cheers, I'm always behind it
                A cool smile is your main weapon
                The sports field court where I met you for the first time
                A movie scene where I felt like a main character
                I'm in that scene with your one pass
                My place under the light of the spotlight
                Those kind words that you threw towards me
                I became a lead actor in that moment

                Oh oh I take one step
                Oh oh give me a highlight
                Oh oh the drama that I dreamed of
                Time to show my play

                This is my drama
                This drama that I dreamed of
                This is my drama

                Those cheers, I'm nobody
                You in the photo sticker is my master
                Oh no, I'm sorry, I stepped over my line
                Extra 1 is completely edited out today as well
                I'm with you but my mind is strange
                My body constantly feels like a CG
                In front of the door called exit that came to me all of a sudden
                My small and tedious ending

                Oh oh goodbye my delusion
                Oh oh approaching bye-bye
                Oh oh drama for you
                Time to get away

                This is your drama
                This is your drama
                This is your drama

                Oh my god
                Your blinding drama
                I'm I'm none of your business
                I'm I'm none of your business
                Oh my good
                A magical drama
                I'm I'm none of your business
                I'm I'm none of your business

                Oh oh this drama on top of a stage
                Oh oh still glorious
                Oh oh we have no problem
                Nothing but my name
                Oh oh goodbye my delusion
                Oh oh approaching bye-bye
                Oh oh drama for you
                Time to get away

                <h2>Can't You See Me [세계가 불타버린 밤, 우린...]</h2>
                <p class="modal-songs-description-eternity">It is a trendy pop genre song with a trap beat and an electro synth. 
                  It tells the story of the confusion and fear experienced in front of a burned world after a magical moment, as well as the loneliness caused by the cracks in friendships. 
                  As befits the lyrics, which contain the feelings of confused boys, you can feel a slightly melancholic and dark atmosphere. It starts with an emotional piano melody, and with unique sound effects and instrumental sounds, it is a song that coexists with a rough yet delicate feeling. 
                  It features whispering vocals and unique narration sections, doubling the fun of listening.

                <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
                <p class="lyrics-eternity"><strong>[Intro: Taehyun]</strong>
                See me
                See me
                Can't you see me?
                Can't you see me?
                Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

                <strong>[Verse 1: Taehyun, Huening Kai, Beomgyu]</strong>
                I'm yours, you're mine, 세계의 비밀
                마법 같던 영원의 그 약속
                별빛 아래 꽃피운 둘만의 Scintilla
                Now see them burn in fire (폐허가 된 여기 재가 된 memories)

                <strong>[Refrain: Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
                (Oh) Together, together, oh woah
                (Oh) We forever, forever, you know
                약속했던 둘만의 somethin', somethin'
                불꽃 속에서 넌 등을 돌리지

                <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
                무너진 모래성, who's a liar?
                세계의 끝에서 춤추는 fire
                안 들리니? 널 찾는 내 목소리
                또 홀로 남겨지는 나 ("구해줘")

                <strong>[Chorus: Hueningkai, Taehyun, Beomgyu]</strong>
                Can't you see me?
                마법의 그날처럼 say "believe me"
                불타버린 내 맘을
                Come and feel me, feel me

                <h2>Fairy of Shampoo</h2>
                <p class="modal-songs-description-eternity">This is the first remake song released by TOMORROW X TOGETHER, and Yeonjun participated in the rap making. 
                  The popular song 'Shampoo Fairy' by singer 'Light and Salt', which was popular in the 1990s, was reinterpreted in the Dream Pop genre, a subgenre of neo-psychedelics. 
                  The fairytale-like lyrics that made him fall in love with the shampoo commercial model on TV, the members' refreshing voices, and a cappella harmonies create a mysterious and dreamy feeling. 
                  The warm yet subtle sound of synth instruments creates a unique atmosphere, and the analog sound hidden throughout the song adds to the retro charm.

                <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
                <p class="lyrics-eternity"><strong>[Verse 1: Beomgyu, Taehyun]</strong>
                네모난 화면 헤치며
                살며시 다가와
                은빛의 환상 심어준
                그녀는 나만의, 작은 요정

                <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Yeonjun, Huening Kai]</strong>
                이른 아침 안개처럼
                내게로 다가와
                너울거리는 긴 머리
                부드런 미소로 속삭이네

                <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
                그녀만 보면, 외롭지 않아
                슬픈 마음도, 멀리 사라져
                그녀는 나의 샴푸의 요정
                이제는, 너를 사랑할 거야

                <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun]</strong>
                그저 넌 존재하는 줄로만
                In a fairytale
                네모난 화면 헤치며 살며시 내게
                다가온 너라는 요정
                왠지 말 건네는 것만 같아
                말로는 설명 안 되는 느낌
                걷는 것만 같은 기분 저기 구름 위를
                어느샌가부터 나의 마음속에
                자리하고 있는 거야 넌 마치

                <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
                이른 아침 안개처럼
                내게로 다가와
                너울거리는 긴 머리
                부드런 미소로 속삭이네

                <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Beomgyu]</strong>
                그녀만 보면, 외롭지 않아
                슬픈 마음도, 멀리 사라져
                그녀는 나의 샴푸의 요정
                이제는, 너를 사랑할 거야

                <strong>[Bridge: Soobin & Huening Kai]</strong>
                멀리서 나 홀로 바라보던
                그녀는 언제나 나의 꿈

                <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
                그녀만 보면 외롭지 않아
                슬픈 마음도 멀리 사라져
                그녀는 나의 샴푸의 요정
                이제는 너를 사랑할 거야

                Gently coming closer
                Planting a silvery illusion
                She is my own little fairy

                Early morning, like a fog
                Coming closer to me
                The flowing long hair

                Whenever I see her I'm not lonely anymore
                My sad heart disappears and goes somewhere far away too
                She is my fairy of shampoo
                Now I will love you

                Pushing through the square screen, you gently
                Came to me, a fairy called you
                It feels like she's talking to me
                This emotion that can't be expressed in words
                It feels like I'm walking on top of those clouds

                <p class="modal-songs-description-eternity">This is a Brit Pop genre song co-produced by 'Slow Rabbit' and Beomgyu, the producer of the division. 
                  It is a self-composed song written and composed by all five members, led by Yeonjun, and was created before TOMORROW X TOGETHER's debut. 
                  She expressed her repetitive daily life during her difficult trainee days in a maze, honestly expressing her desperate desire for someone to find her and her feelings of loneliness. 
                  The song progresses with only minimalist instruments of guitar, piano, and bass, as well as the members' emotional and calm vocals, providing a calm impression.

                끝은 어딜까 달려 보지만
                In the mirror 속의 미로
                보호란 통제가 날 가두고
                아파도 더는 투정 부리면 안 돼
                나를 꼭 감춰둔 세상, 세상
                Please don't give up on me
                We'll be going up, 넘어지지 마
                In the mirror 속 네 위로
                커다란 틀에 날 맞추기엔
                여전히 작고 작은 것만 같은데
                나를 좀 찾아줘 제발, 제발

                <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
                거울 앞에서 난 또 굴복해
                여긴 너무 컴컴해
                여리기만 한 내 어깬
                숨지도 펴지도 못해
                미로 속 끝에, 미로 속 끝에
                거울 저 편에, 저기 저 편에
                나를 찾아줘 제발, 제발
                Please don't give up on me

                No, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
                여리기만 한 내 어깰
                기대어 쉴 수가 있게
                쉴 수 있게
                No, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

                빛을 따라 난 손을 뻗지만
                In the mirror, 속 날 밀어
                깨지고 나뉜 그 형체 속에
                나조차 진짜 날 찾을 수 없게 해

                <strong>[Bridge: Taehyun, Huening Kai]</strong>
                이젠 날고 싶어
                영원을 나는 피터팬처럼 (Fly, fly, fly)
                별이 되고 싶어
                처음 흘렸던 그 맑은 땀처럼

                나를 찾아줘 제발, 제발 (제발, 제발)
                Please don't give up on me (Me)

                <strong>[Post-Chorus: Beomgyu, Yeonjun & Taehyun, Soobin, Huening Kai]</strong>

                No, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh (No)
                여리기만 한 내 어깰 (Oh)
                기대어 쉴 수가 있게 (Hah, ah, ah)
                쉴 수 있게

                <p class="lyrics-eternity">Where is the end, I try to run
                In the mirror, a maze
                A restriction called protection lock me up
                I can't complain anymore even though it hurts
                This world, world that hid me
                Please don't give up on me
                We'll be going up don't fall
                In the mirror, above you who is inside
                Trying to fit myself in this big frame
                I feel so small and still so small
                Find me please, please

                I surrender in front of the mirror again
                It's too dark here
                My delicate shoulders
                Neither can I hide nor can I straighten them
                At the end of the maze, at the end of the maze
                On the other side, on the other side of the mirror

                No oh oh oh oh oh oh
                My shoulder which is delicate
                So that I can rest while leaning on it
                So that I can rest
                No oh oh oh oh oh oh

                I reach my hand out towards the light
                In the mirror I push myself
                In that figure that's broken and divided
                I can't even find my real self
                Find me please, please

                I surrender in front of the mirror again

                Find me please, please
                Please don't give up on me

                I want to fly now
                Like Peter Pan that flies in eternity (fly fly fly)
                I want to become a star
                Like that clear sweat that broke out for the first time

                I surrender in front of the mirror again
                It's too dark here
                My delicate shoulders
                Neither can I hide nor can I straighten them
                At the end of the maze, at the end of the maze
                On the other side, on the other side of the mirror

                <h2>Fairy of Shampoo</h2>
                <p class="modal-songs-description-eternity">A puma who escaped from the zoo. They compared the image of a boy who feels the thrill of encountering a strange world and the freedom he tastes for the first time, but feels fear as he collides with a world that gradually rejects him, to a cougar that has escaped from the zoo. 
                  The unique lyrics, captured from the perspective of a fierce beast longing for freedom, stand out. It is a hip hop song based on the trap genre with a strong feel, and although the instrumentation is simple, it conveys explosive energy with just a repetitive rhythm. 
                  The hip-hop vibe is strong and heavy, allowing you to feel the expanded musical spectrum of TOMORROW X TOGETHER.

                <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
                <p class="lyrics-eternity"><strong>[Refrain: Beomgyu, Soobin]</strong>
                  West side, east side
                  Didn't know where to where to go, no
                  Tonight, we ride
                  적막한 이 밤의 소음
                  어둠 속 저 문이 열려
                  누가 막아 아무도
                  West side, east side, it doesn't matter anymore

                  <strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Soobin, Beomgyu]</strong>
                  뜨거, 뜨거, 뜨거, 뜨거
                  뜨거 발이 데인 나
                  눈떠 느껴 숨 쉬어 꿈꿔, 꿈꿔왔던 세상
                  생애 제일 거대한 night sky
                  내 발의 speed는 벌써 마하
                  눈앞의 저 green light, 뭐가, 뭐가, 두려워
                  They came, catch my back, 절대 잡히면 안 돼
                  They came, catch my friends, 짙게 깔린 저 안개
                  여긴 사방은 까맣고 (It's coming)
                  심각한 분위기로 (Turn it up)
                  귓가에 들리는 건
                  Bang, bang, bang, 달려야 해

                  <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Huening Kai]</strong>
                  But 왠지 나는 기뻐
                  처음 느껴본 이 기분
                  처음 자유를 만난 지금 (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
                  Ooh, 왠지 나는 기뻐
                  내 선택이 내 leader, 내가 나의 believer
                  (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

                  <strong>[Post-Chorus: Yeonjun, Taehyun]</strong>
                  (Ooh, woah-woah-woah) 두근대네 심장이
                  (Ooh, woah-woah-woah, oh) 처음 보는 나의 피
                  (Ooh, woah-woah-woah) 번져가네 조금씩
                  (Ooh, woah-woah-woah, oh)
                  나를 뛰게 하는, 뛰게 하는 피

                  <strong>[Verse 2: Huening Kai, Taehyun, Soobin, Beomgyu, *Yeonjun*]</strong>
                  동물원을 벗어나고 나서
                  마주친 세상은 너무 낯선
                  누구 하나도 나를 안 반겨
                  매일 같은 걸음아 날 살려 race
                  밤이 되면 저 달엔
                  얼굴 그리웠던 엄마의
                  서글퍼진 맘, 내 두 번째 걸음마 (*I told ya, hey*)

                  <strong>[Verse 3: Yeonjun]</strong>
                  홀로 서기엔 아직 너무 어려
                  이 세상은 jungle full of warriors
                  조준경이 너의 목을 노려
                  수천 개의 눈이 인터넷에 접속
                  조심해 네 적이 삽시간에 퍼져
                  꿈에 닿을 때까지 얼마나 더 걸려?
                  그 질문엔 매번 총성만이 번져
                  난 계속 숨을 쉬기 위해, 다시 run up

                  <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
                  But 왠지 나는 기뻐
                  처음 느껴본 이 기분
                  처음 자유를 만난 지금 (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
                  Ooh, 왠지 나는 기뻐
                  내 선택이 내 leader, 내가 나의 believer (Believer)
                  (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, urgh)

                  <strong>[Post-Chorus: Yeonjun, Taehyun]</strong>
                  (Ooh, woah-woah-woah) Yeah-eh, 두근대네 심장이
                  (Ooh, woah-woah-woah, oh) 처음 보는 나의 피 (Ah-ah)
                  (Ooh, woah-woah-woah) 번져가네 조금씩
                  (Ooh, woah-woah-woah, oh)
                  나를 뛰게 하는, 뛰게 하는 피

                  <strong>[Refrain: Beomgyu, Soobin, Huening Kai]</strong>
                  West side, east side
                  Didn't know where to where to go, no (Didn't know where to where to go)
                  Tonight, we ride
                  적막한 이 밤의 소음 (밤의 소음)

                <p class="lyrics-eternity">West side, east side
                Didn't know where to, where to go
                Tonight we ride
                A noise in this silent night
                In the darkness, that door opens
                Who can stop it? No one
                West side, east side
                It doesn't matter anymore

                Hot hot hot hot
                Hot, I burned my feet
                Open your eyes, feel it, breathe, dream
                This world I dreamed of
                The biggest night sky in my life
                The speed of my feel is already mach
                That green light in front of me
                What what am I afraid of
                They came, catch my back
                I can't be caught
                They came, catch my friends
                That thick fog that settled
                Everywhere is black here
                In this serious atmosphere
                What I hear from my ears
                Bang bang bang
                I have to run

                But for some reason I'm happy
                This emotion I feel for the first time
                This moment I feel freedom for the first time
                Woo for some reason I'm happy
                My choice is my leader
                I am my believer

                It's beating, my heart
                I see my blood for the first time
                Slowly, it spreads
                This blood that makes me run, run

                After I escape the zoo
                The world I face is too unfamiliar
                No one even greets me
                Everyday, the same, “feet, please save me race”
                At night, on that moon
                Face, my mom who I was longing for
                My sorrowful heart
                My second step (I told ya)

                Still too young to stand alone
                This world is a jungle full of warriors
                The scope is aiming at your throat
                A thousand eyes are accessing the internet
                Be careful, your enemies spread in an instant
                “How long does it take to reach your dream?”
                Only gunshots spread with that question all the time
                So that I can continue to bread, again run up

                But for some reason I'm happy
                This emotion I feel for the first time
                This moment I feel freedom for the first time
                Woo for some reason I'm happy
                My choice is my leader
                I am my believer

                It's beating, my heart
                I see my blood for the first time
                Slowly, it spreads
                This blood that makes me run, run

                West side, east side
                Didn't know where to, where to go
                Tonight we ride
                A noise in this silent night
                In the darkness, that door opens

                <h2>Eternally</h2>
                <p class="modal-songs-description-eternity">It is a song about boys who chase familiar and unfamiliar longing and search for memories of the past. 
                  It contains questions about the mysterious beings and unknown emotions that lead them in repeated nightmares. 
                  It is an alternative R&B song that starts with dreamy Acoustic Pop and transitions to a completely different beat with a dark and ominous aura. 
                  The tracks, which are minimalist and filled with fragmented noise, give it an experimental feel, and the members' new vocal styles add a touch of uniqueness.
                  The simple and repetitive melody line is addictive.</p>

                  악몽을 부르는 춤 끝나지 않는 리듬
                  (Hm, hm, hm, hm-mm, hm, hm, hm, da-da-da)
                  (Hm, hm, hm, hm-mm, hm, hm, hm, da-da-da)
                  비명을 삼킨 이 어둠 커지는 너와 내 틈
                  눈앞에 펼쳐진 이 낙서 다시 꿈속을 헤쳐
                  (Hm, hm, hm, hm-mm, hm, hm, hm, da-da-da)
                  (Hm, hm, hm, hm-mm, hm, hm, hm, da-da-da, hm)

                  추억의 미로 속 잠긴 내 마음 (Hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm)
                  구해줘 날 (Hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm)
                  영원의 꿈 제일 깊은 곳 (Hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm)
                  잠든 푸른색 비밀로

                  <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun]</strong>
                  (Hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm)
                  Don't go breaking my heart, don't go (Hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm)
                  조각난 세상 (Hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm)
                  잊혀진 둘의 일기 속 (Hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm)
                  데려가 줘 그 비밀로 (Hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm)

                <p class="lyrics-eternity">Please stop
                This nightmare that I dream every night
                Your hand which is so close yet so far
                Tell me now
                That name that hovers in my mouth
                The meaning of this sad dream

                My mind which is stuck in a nostalgic maze
                Save me
                In this eternal dream that is the deepest,
                My blue secret that is asleep

                Don't go breaking my heart, don't go
                This broken world
                In this forgotten diary for two
                Take me to that secret

                When I open my eyes, that night
                That day when flaming rain came down
                That dance that called for a nightmare
                That rhythm that won't stop
                This darkness that swallowed a scream
                This gap between you and me is growing bigger
                This doodle in front of my eyes
                I push through my dream again

                My mind which is stuck in a nostalgic maze
                Save me
                In this eternal dream that is the deepest,
                My blue secret that is asleep

                Don't go breaking my heart, don't go
                This broken world
                In this forgotten diary for two
                Take me to that secret

                I want to end this world

                When I open my eyes, that night
                That day when flaming rain came down
                That dance that called for a nightmare
                That rhythm that won't stop
