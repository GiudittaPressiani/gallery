        <p>Gen Z's 'it' boys TOMORROW X TOGETHER continue their journey through the newest EP, minisode 2: Thursday's Child.
        In minisode 2: Thursday's Child, the experience of a first breakup strikes as a powerful storm mixed with denial, dejection, anger, and loss. Our protagonist fully indulges in and expresses each of these emotions as they come, until he is finally able to accept that his once treasured relationship has come to an end. Moving from adolescence to adulthood, the boy comes to better understand both himself and the world around him. Then, a question arises: on what path of growth will his feet lead him next?
        Minisode 2: Thursday's Child is a post-farewell recollection with five tracks total: “Good Boy Gone Bad,” “Trust Fund Baby,” “Opening Sequence,” and TOMORROW X TOGETHER's first two unit tracks, “Lonely Boy” and “Thursday's Child Has Far To Go.” The members have made creative contributions to all tracks in the EP.<br>
