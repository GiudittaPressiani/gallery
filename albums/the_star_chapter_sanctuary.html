    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-sanctuary"><strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Beomgyu, Yeonjun & Beomgyu]</strong>
    Heaven, 잠들었던 별빛이 awaken
    천국은 먼 곳이 아닌 지금
    입 맞춘 그 순간
    You make it, you make it, you make it feel like

    <strong>[Verse 1: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    잠에서 깬 별빛들에 싸여, baby
    한가운데 너와 입을 맞춰 crazy
    약속했던 시작에서 만난 magic
    Look what you did, look what you did to me like

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Taehyun, Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Oh, my God, 천국은 없던 sad song
    널 만나 심장도 온기를 느껴
    다가와 and when you hold me close
    You make it, you make it, you make it feel like

    <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    Heaven, 잠들었던 별빛이 awaken
    천국은 먼 곳이 아닌 지금
    입 맞춘 그 순간
    You make it, you make it, you make it feel like
    Heaven, from one to ten, you're like an eleven
    너만 있다면 그곳이 heaven
    My angel every night
    You make it, you make it, you make it feel like

    <strong>[Verse 2: Beomgyu, Taehyun]</strong>
    천국은 늘 멀기만 했었지 내겐
    하얀 구름 위를 걷는 듯해 이젠
    너만 내게 걸 수 있는 마법 maybe
    Look what you did, look what you did to me like

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai, Soobin, Yeonjun & Soobin]</strong>
    Oh, my God, 멈추지 않을 love song
    널 만나 세상의 온기를 느껴
    꽉 안아 첫날의 약속처럼
    You make it, you make it, you make it feel like

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Beomgyu, Soobin]</strong>
    Heaven, 상관없어 그곳이 어디든
    천국은 먼 곳이 아닌 지금
    맞닿은 그 순간
    You make it, you make it, you make it feel like
    Heaven, from one to ten, you're like an eleven
    너만 있다면 그곳이 heaven
    My angel every night
    You make it, you make it, you make it feel like heaven</p>

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-sanctuary">The starlight that fell asleep awakens 
    Heaven is not a place far away, it's right know 
    The moment we kiss,
    You make it, you make it  
    You make it feel like 

    Wrapped by the starlight that woke up
    From its slumber
    In the middle of it, I kiss you
    Crazy the magic that
    we promised at the start
    Look what you did, 
    look what you did to me

    Oh, my God, there was never a sad song 
    In heaven 
    Since I've met you, even my heart feels warmth
    Come closer and when you hold me close, 
    You make it, you make it
    You make it feel like heaven 

    The starlight that fell asleep awakens 
    Heaven is not a place far away, it's right know 
    The moment we kiss,
    You make it, you make it  
    You make it feel like heaven 

    From 1 to 10 you're like an 11
    As long as you're there, 
    Every place is heaven 
    My angel every night, 
    You make it, you make it 
    You make it feel like 

    Heaven always felt far away to me, 
    Now it feel like I'm walking on white clouds 
    A magic only you can cast on me, maybe 
    Look what you did, 
    Look what you did to me, like  

    Oh, my God, 
    This never-ending love song 
    Since I've met you, my world feels warmth 
    High me tight, like we promised on the first day </p>
    <p class="modal-note-sanctuary">Note: the lyrics “hug me tight, like we promised on the first day” is a reference to the lyric “I'll hug you tight like i promised on the first day” from 'Deja Vu'</p>
    <p class="lyrics-sanctuary">You make it, you make it
    You make it feel like heaven

    It doesn't matter where that place is 
    Heaven is not a place far away,
    It's right now 
    The moment that we touch,
    You make it, you make it
    You make it feel like heaven

    From 1 to 10 you're like an 11
    As long as you're there, 
    Every place is heaven 
    My angel every night, 
    You make it, you make it 
    You make it feel like</p>

    <strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Taehyun]</strong>
    이제 너 없인 난 색을 잃은 sunset
    넌 날 존재하게 한 전제
    삶은 널 앗아 가길 원해
    My mind lost all the control
    우릴 둘러싼 모든 게
    네 곁에서 날 밀어내
    But I'ma get down with you
    Down with you, down with, down with you

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai]</strong>
    마주 잡은 두 손이
    낙원이라 믿으니
    뿌리를 내려 next to you, ah, ah

    <strong>[Chorus: Beomgyu, Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    널 보면 I can resist, 넌 나의 유일
    I can't exist, 네가 없인
    'Cause I don't wanna live without ya (I can resist)
    널 위해 뭐든 견디겠어 (I can resist)

    <strong>[Interlude: Yeonjun]</strong>
    Resist
    Resist

    <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun, Huening Kai]</strong>
    널 위해서란 뻔한
    성의 없는 거짓말 don't care
    보잘것없었던 나일지라도
    네 손을 잡은 난 one and only가 돼
    내가 널 원하는 만큼
    나만큼 너도 need me too
    So I'ma get down with you
    Down with you, down with, down with you

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Taehyun]</strong>
    유일무이 너만이
    나를 살게 할 테니
    감당할게 next to you, ah, ah

    <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Huening Kai, Beomgyu, Yeonjun, *Taehyun*]</strong>
    널 보면 I can resist, I have no fear
    I can't exist, 네가 없인
    잔혹한 세상일지라도 (I can resist)
    멍든 가슴을 끌어안고 (I can resist)
    널 위해 I can resist, 넌 나의 공기
    I can't exist, 네가 없인
    *Not gonna run away without ya* (I can resist)
    *널 세게 끌어안고 버텨* (I can resist)</p>

    <h2>Forty One Winks</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-sanctuary">Based on 'Forty winks', which means
    a short nap, the flickering of a star after waking up from a nap is interpreted as the '41st wink'. The fairytale-like imagination unique to 
    TOMORROW X TOGETHER, which expresses the reunited 'you' and 'me' as a star waking up, stands out. They talk about a special relationship that 
    brings each other to their comfort zone with just the blink of an eye. It is a medium-tempo R&B song with warm and affectionate emotions, and 
    the combination of rich sound and groovy rhythm is impressive.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-sanctuary"><strong>[Intro]</strong>
    Ooh, ooh, ooh
    Ooh, ooh, ooh
    Ooh, ooh, ooh
    Ooh, ooh, ooh (Incoming!)

    <strong>[Verse 1: Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    물든 오렌지빛 석양은 blue (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
    순간 서늘해진 마음의 틈, you
    안심하란 듯 깜빡인 너의 눈 (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
    별처럼 인사해, I'm with you, you

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai]</strong>
    나만 보이게 반짝인
    네 마흔한 번째의 wink
    수 천마디의 말 대신
    날 위로해

    <strong>[Chorus: Beomgyu, Soobin]</strong>
    신호를 보내 forty-one winks (Yeah, yeah)
    마치 morse code 같지 (Yeah, yeah)
    눈을 깜빡이는 그 순간
    우린 함께야
    속삭여 줄래 별의 language (Yeah, yeah)
    둘만이 아는 얘기 (Yeah, yeah)
    먼 우주를 건너 내게만
    건넨 따스함

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Yeonjun]</strong>
    (별의 language) 보내 줘 forty-one winks (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
    (별의 language) 눈을 깜빡이는 그 순간 (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
    우린 함께야

    <strong>[Verse 2: Beomgyu, Soobin]</strong>
    Ha, 기댈 곳 없는 도시의 소란함 (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
    때론 다시 헤맬지 몰라 우린
    문득 떠오르는 네 따스함 (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
    나를 안식처로 데려가 다시, oh

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Yeonjun]</strong>
    잠들지 못한 내 뺨 위
    나비의 날개 같은 kiss
    말보다 강렬한 의미
    그거면 돼

    <strong>Chorus: Huening Kai & Yeonjun, Huening Kai, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    너와 나만의 forty-one winks (Yeah, yeah; Ooh)
    언어 그 이상의 something (Yeah, yeah; 언어 그 이상의)
    눈을 깜빡이는 그 순간 (Yeah, yeah)
    우린 함께야 (Ooh)
    우리만 아는 그런 language (Yeah, yeah; Language)
    별이 반짝거리듯이 (Yeah, yeah; Ooh)
    먼 우주를 건너 내게만
    건넨 따스함

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Beomgyu, Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    (별의 language)
    너와 나만의 language (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
    We don't even have to say it
    (별의 language)
    보이지 않아도 언제나 (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
    함께 you and I</p>

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-sanctuary">The orange-tinted sunset turns blue 
    Suddenly the gap in my heart is chilly 
    Your eyes blinked as if to reassure me 
    Greet me like a star, “I'm with you”

    Twinkled so only I can see 
    Your forty-first wink 
    Rather than a thousand words
    It reassures me 

    Sending a signal, forty one winks 
    It's like a morse code
    The moment you blink your eyes 
    We're together </p>

    <p class="modal-note-sanctuary"> Note: once again, the “Morse Code” returns, a recurring motif in TXT's journey since their debut </p>

    <p class="lyrics-sanctuary">Can you whisper the star's language 
    The story only the two of us know 
    Across the far universe, just to me 
    That warmth is given 

    (The star's language)
    (Send me forty one winks)
    (The star's language)
    (The moment you blink your eyes)
    (We're together)

    The commotion of the city 
    With nowhere to lean on 
    Sometimes, we might end up 
    Losing our way again 
    Suddenly, I remember your warmth
    You bring me back to a safe place 

    When I can't sleep, on my cheeks
    Like the wings of a butterfly, a kiss
    A meaning that's stronger than words
    That's all I need 

    Our own forty one winks 
    More than a language 
    It's something 
    The moment you blink your eyes 
    We're together 

    Only the two of us 
    Know that language 
    Like how the stars are twinkling 
    Across the far universe 
    Just to me that warmth is given 

    (The star's language)
    (A language of just you and me)
    (We don't even have to say it)
    (The star's language)
    (Even if we can't see, always)
    (We're together, you and I)</p>

    <h2>Higher Than Heaven</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-sanctuary"> This song is in line with the first track 'Heaven', where you sing that if your magic took me to heaven, now I want to take you to a higher place than heaven. It is a rock-style song that everyone can enjoy together at the concert hall. The bright-toned electric guitar, heart-pounding beat, and upbeat rhythm combine to create a hopeful and energetic energy. Taehyun participated in the lyrics.</p>

    <p class="lyrics-sanctuary"><strong>[Verse 1: Beomgyu]</strong>
    포근히 반겨 오는 별빛에 (Hey, hey)
    두 발 아랜 heaven
    이 리듬에 맞춰 밤새 너와 춤출래

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Taehyun, Soobin]</strong>
    나를 바라본 너의 두 눈빛은 shine
    그 아래 더 이상 방황하지 않아
    네가 내게 준 마법 같은 힘으로
    I'll take you

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin, Soobin & Yeonjun]</strong>
    Higher
    Higher than heaven (Ooh-oh, ooh, ooh)
    천국 저 너머
    더 높은 곳으로
    Fly with me

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
    High, high, high
    어디든 날아가 you and me
    High, high, high
    어디든 날아가 you and me

    <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    땅끝만 헤매던 매일
    널 만나 만들어 수많은 내일
    지금처럼 나를 바라보며
    그렇게 환하게 웃어주면
    별빛을 나침반 삼아서
    네 손을 버팀목 삼아서
    지킬게 영원을, 우리의 이름을
    계속될 내일을 함께 꿈꿔

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    황홀한 감정만 가득 머금은 heart
    난 이제 영원의 뜻을 알 것 같아
    네가 내게 준 마법 같은 힘으로
    I'll take you

    Higher than heaven (Ooh-oh, ooh, ooh)

    여기가 우리의 start line
    우릴 지켜 주는 starlight
    낙원보다 먼 곳까지
    Higher and higher and high

    <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Huening Kai, Soobin & Yeonjun]</strong>
    Higher
    Higher than heaven (Ooh-oh, ooh, ooh)
    영원에 담길
    꿈을 꿔 너와 난
    Fly with me

    <p class="lyrics-sanctuary">The starlight that comfortingly greets me
    Beneath my two feet, heaven 
    I wanna dance with you all night
    To the rhythm of this beat 

    You two eyes looking at me, they shine
    Underneath that, 
    I won't stray away anymore
    With that magical strength you gave me
    I'll take you 

    Higher, 
    Higher than heaven 
    Beyond heaven 
    A higher place
    Fly with me 

    High, high, high
    We'll fly anywhere, you and me 
    High, high, high
    We'll fly anywhere, you and me 

    Everyday, i had wandered around
    The edge of the earth 
    With you, we make so many tomorrows 
    If you look at me, just like now
    And smile brightly like that 

    Using starlight as a compass
    Using my hand for support
    We'll protect our forever, our name 
    We'll dream the tomorrow 
    That'll continue 

    Ecstatic feelings fill my heart 
    I think I finally understand the 
    Meaning of “forever”
    With that magical strength 
    You gave me 
    I'll take you 

    Higher, 
    Higher than heaven 
    Beyond heaven 
    A higher place
    Fly with me 

    High, high, high
    We'll fly anywhere, you and me 
    High, high, high
    We'll fly anywhere, you and me 

    This is our start line, 
    The starlight that has been protecting it
    To places further than paradise 
    Higher and higher and high </p>
