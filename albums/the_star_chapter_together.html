        <p>Picking up where their previous release, the seventh mini album “The Star Chapter: SANCTUARY,” left off, “The Star Chapter: TOGETHER” marks the final page of “The Star Chapter.” It tells the story of how “we” save each other by calling each other's names. The word “TOGETHER,” which is also a part of the group's name, was chosen to make the album even more special. <br><br>
        This album speaks to the true meaning of “TOGETHER.” From the feeling of being with someone you care about even if the world is turned upside down (“Upside Down Kiss”), to the determination to save that person and move forward into the world together (“Beautiful Strangers”), a fatal love that you would willingly fall into (“Ghost Girl”), a leisurely time just for two (“Sunday Driver”), the desire to understand and resemble the person you love (“Dance With You”), the happiness that comes from sharing (“Take My Half”), the encouragement to move forward to tomorrow even on sleepless nights (“Bird of Night”), and all the way to the happiness that only comes when “we” are together (“Song of the Stars”). TOMORROW X TOGETHER has musically captured the essence and meaning of "TOGETHER."</p>
