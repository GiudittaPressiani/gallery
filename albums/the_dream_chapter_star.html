        <h2>BLUE ORANGEADE</h2>

        <p class="modal-songs-description-star"><i>
          'Blue Orangeade' is a song that freshly interprets the encounter with the opposite person who is too different with the phenomenon of complementary color contrast. New Jack Swing, a genre that was popular from the mid-80s to the early 90s, was made into a trendy yet youthful feel to match the image of TOMORROW X TOGETHER. It is said that it is a special relationship in which we are attracted and attracted to things that we do not have, just like the complementary color relationship between blue and orange.

        Ayy! Oh!
        Doo-doo-doo

        <strong>[Verse 1: Beomgyu, Yeonjun]</strong>
        Someone say, what's going on?
        대체 어떻게 넌
        너와 정반대인 앨 만나니

        넌 파란 바다를 좋아해
        But I like violet 또
        가고 싶어 산으로
        우린 정반대인 거야

        Whoa, yeah
        Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

        <strong>[Verse 1: Beomgyu, Soobin]</strong>
        거울 속에서 나를 멍하니 보는 넌
        내가 아냐 (Yah, yah, yah)
        어지러운 두통과 something on my head (Ah, ah-ah)
        이대로 도망치고 싶어
        사라지고 싶어 저 멀리 (Yah, yah, yah)
        (구해줘) 난 누구?
        I don't know who I am (Ah, ah-ah)

        <strong>[Refrain: Huening Kai, Beomgyu, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
        내 몸이 미쳤나 봐
        내 머리엔 뿔이 돋아
        어떡해 멈출지를 몰라
        Oh, ah, 세상 속 나 혼자 나빠
        구해줘 어쩌면 난 괴물이 된지도 몰라
        Got no one but you

        <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
        Who you, you?
        버려진 날 찾은 넌 구원인 걸까?
        (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
        Who you, you?
        네 날개도 나와 같은 아픔인 걸까?

        <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun, Soobin]</strong>
        머리에 뿔이 솟아
        But I love it
        넌 내 왕관이 되지
        두근두근 두근대는 감각
        심장은 대혼란
        But I love it
        비로소 완벽해진
        우리 둘이 둘이 둘이잖아

        <strong>[Post-Chorus: Soobin, Beomgyu]</strong>
        Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
        외로움 멈춰라 마수리 수리
        Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
        Ooh, yah, yah, yah

        Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
        Ooh, yah, yah, yah

        <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>
        세상은 대체 왜 이래 나한테 (Skrr)
        하루아침에 뿔이 달린 내 상태 (Woo)
        빛이 있을까? 악마한테도
        그때 눈앞에서 펼쳐진 네 날개
        말해줘 너의 반쪽을
        완성하는 건 나잖아
        내 이름이 불리워진 이 순간

        <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
        Who you, you?
        버려진 날 찾은 넌 구원인 걸까?

        Ooh, yah, yah, yah

        <strong>[Bridge: Soobin, Beomgyu & Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
        사실 아직도 난 조금 불안해
        차가운 냉소와 외로움 중간에 서 있어
        Nobody can understand (Nobody)
        It's you
        너의 존재가 마법처럼 내 세상을 바꿔 (Wow)
        난 이젠 안 아파
        I got crown on my head

        <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>

        두근두근 두근대는 감각 (-각)
        심장은 대혼란 (괜찮아)
        But I love it
        비로소 완벽해진

        <strong>[Post-Chorus: Soobin, Beomgyu, Taehyun]</strong>
        Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
        외로움 멈춰라 마수리 수리
        Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Baby, baby, bae)

        Stop the agony abracadabra
        Oh oh oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh, ya ya ya

        Why is the world doing this to me (skrrt)
        My condition is horns growing in a single morning
        Is there light? Even for a demon
        Then your wings spread out in front of my eyes

        Tell me, I'm the one completing your other half
        This moment my name is called
        Maybe you're a savior that found me, who was thrown away (ah ah ah)

        (Who you, you?)
        Maybe your wings are the same pain as mine

        Horns are growing on my head
        But I love it
        You become my crown
        Pit-a-pat beating sensation
        My heart is a big confusion
        But I love it
        Perfect at last
        It's the two two two of us ah

        Oh oh oh oh oh
        Stop the loneliness abracadabra
        Oh oh oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh, ya ya ya
        Oh oh oh oh oh
        Stop the agony abracadabra
        Oh oh oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh, ya ya ya

        To be honest, I'm still a bit anxious
        I'm standing in the middle of the cold sarcastic smile and loneliness
        Nobody can understand (nobody)
        But it's you
        Your existence changes my world like magic
        I'm not hurting anymore (I got a crown on my head, crown on my head)

        Horns are growing on my head
        But I love it
        You become my crown
        Pit-a-pat beating sensation
        My heart is a big confusion
        But I love it
        Perfect at last
        It's the two two two of us ah

        Oh oh oh oh oh
        Stop the loneliness abracadabra
        Oh oh oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh, ya ya ya
        Oh oh oh oh oh
        Stop the agony abracadabra
        Oh oh oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh, ya ya ya

        <p class="modal-songs-description-star"><i>'Our Summer' is produced by The Futuristics, which has worked with world-class artists such as Halsey, Selena Gomez and Camila Cabello. 
          It is not a fixed season, but a symbolic time or space where you can enjoy friendship and adventure. It is a house-pop genre with a relaxing and sweet melody and a catchy vocal synth theme. 
          If you focus on the lyrics that blend well into the melody, it will be a song that reminds you of your own 'Our Summer' that you experienced at least once someday.</i></p>

        <strong>[Verse 1: Huening Kai, Soobin]</strong>
        타오르는 태양 아래 질척이며 녹아가네
        회색빛의 빌딩 숲
        끝이 없는 기말고사 뒤척이며 잠 못 드는
        잿빛 도시의 소음

        <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
        한순간 나타난 너의 환상
        마법같이 빛나
        부서지는 파도소리 너의 웃음
        내게 손 내밀 때

        <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
        눈앞에 펼쳐진 건 우윳빛 은하수
        피어난 금빛 계절 like our summer
        어디에 있어도 어떤 계절에도
        우리가 함께라면 feel like summer

        <strong>[Verse 2: Beomgyu, Taehyun]</strong>
        싱그런 너의 향기 반짝이는 너의 눈빛
        내 맘 일렁이게 해
        현실은 힘을 잃고 지구조차 숨죽이고
        순간은 영원이 돼

        <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Huening Kai]</strong>
        뜨거운 태양 아래 너와 난
        이젠 우리가 돼
        회색빛깔 도시 위로 푸르른
        파도가 쏟아져

        <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
        눈앞에 펼쳐진 건 우윳빛 은하수
        피어난 금빛 계절 like our summer

        우리가 함께라면 feel like summer

        <strong>[Post-Chorus: Taehyun]</strong>
        Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

        <strong>[Bridge: Huening Kai, Beomgyu]</strong>
        가을 겨울 또 봄이 온대도
        우리 함께면
        황금빛 모래 여름 바다 위
        뜨거운 태양

        <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
        (Oh) 그 속에 영원의 약속이
        찬란하게 빛나 (하게 빛나)
        상상한다면 계속 믿는다면
        네가 있다는 걸 (Ooh, ooh)

        Under the blazing sun, it's sticky
        It's melting, the grey-colored forest of buildings
        The never-ending final exam
        Tossing and turning, the sleepless noise of the ashy city

        The illusion of you that appeared in an instant 
        Shines bright like magic
        The sound of breaking waves
        Your smile when your hand reaches out to mine
        What unfolds in front of my eyes

        Is the milky light in the galaxy
        The golden season bloomed
        Like our summer
        No matter where I am
        No matter what season it is
        If we're together
        feel like summer

        Your refreshing scent, your sparkling eyes
        Make my heart sway
        Reality loses its strength, even the world holds its breath
        This moment becomes eternity

        Under the hot sun, you and I now become 'us'
        Above the grey-colored city, the blue waves spill over
        What unfolds in front of my eyes

        Is the milky light in the galaxy
        The golden season bloomed
        Like our summer
        No matter where I am
        No matter what season it is
        If we're together
        feel like summer

        Even if autumn, winter, and spring come
        If we're together
        Above the golden sand and the summer sea
        The hot sun

        Within it, the promise of eternity shines brightly
        If I imagine it, if I keep believing, you're there
        What unfolds in front of my eyes

        Is the milky light in the galaxy
        The golden season bloomed

        <p class="modal-songs-description-star"><i>I used to be like a cunning and domineering cat, but I am changing because of you. 'Cat & Dog' adds a marimba melody to the trap rhythm to create a cute atmosphere. 
        The song stands out with the members' Mumble Rap, and the narrator sings about the inner changes that occur when meeting someone. 
        The fresh heart that compares the relationship between a pet and a butler, which may be the purest, resembles a scene that anyone would have in their heart. 
        I am surprised and embarrassed by the change I feel for the first time, but the important thing is that I like this change that came one day.

        <h2>NAP OF A STAR (별의 낮잠)</h2>

        <p class="modal-songs-description-star"><i>Nap of the Stars This is a soft modern rock song where you can feel the beautiful harmony of the five members on top of the
        faint electric guitar playing. Extremely restrained instrument composition and delicate voices of the members.
        The meaning of stars and naps is a complex meaning of childhood 'dreams', 'anxiety', and 'unattainable ideals', but on the other hand, it also contains the process of forgetting something and overcoming it step by step. 
        The "brilliant night sky" and "magical moment" in the second half of the lyrics are not stories that only appear in songs or fairy tales, but are beautiful moments hidden in the unconscious of all of us.
        While listening to the song, why not think of your own star that was taking a nap deep in your heart for a while?

        I can see 내 앞에 네가 없어도
        I feel you 아무 말 하지 않아도
        Because I believe in you 불안해도
        I can touch 눈앞에 네가 없어도
        I reach 내게서 멀리 떠나도
        너의 기억만으로도 내 마음은 언제나
        춤추는 걸 예전처럼

        <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Soobin & Huening Kai]</strong>
        너의 낮잠이 되어서 같이 꿈을 꾸고 싶어 언제나
        아무 일 없었단 듯이
        노을이 지는 저녁도 캄캄해진 밤하늘도
        내 맘엔 너로 가득 차 있어

        <strong>[Verse 2: Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
        별빛에 춤추던 어린 시절의 기억들
        이젠 점점 희미해져 간다 해도
        네 꿈속에선 함께였으면 좋겠어
        선명하게

        <strong>[Chorus: Beomgyu, Soobin]</strong>
        밤하늘에 널 불러도 대답 없는 검은 침묵 무서워
        이대로 잊게 될까 봐
        마법 같던 그 순간들 너와 걷던 밤하늘도
        꿈처럼 그냥 사라질까 봐

        <strong>[Bridge: Yeonjun, Huening Kai, Beomgyu, Soobin]</strong>
        꿈속에서 네가
        천천히 다가와
        나에게 말했어
        많이 그리워한다고
        눈물이 흐르는 나에게
        걱정 말라고 (걱정 말라고)
        조용히 말했어
        Doo-doo-doo-doodoo (do)

        <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>
        너의 낮잠이 되어서 같이 꿈을 꾸고 싶어 언제나
        아무 일 없었단 듯이
        마법 같던 그 순간들 찬란했던 밤하늘도

        As if nothing happened
        Even in the evening when the sun sets and in the night sky that turned dark
        My heart is filled completely with you

        Woo woooo
        Woo woooo

        When the starlight danced, the memories of our childhood
        Even though it might become dimmer
        I wish we're together in your dream, vividly

        Even though I call you in the night sky, the black silence has no answer, I’m scared
        That we'll forget like this
        Even the magical moments, the night sky that I walked with you
        That it might just disappear like a dream

        In my dream, you came to be slowly and told me
        That you miss me a lot
        To me who was tearing up, you said not to worry (to not worry)
        You said it softly

        I want to be your nap and dream together, always
        As if nothing happened
        Even in the evening when the sun sets and in the night sky that turned dark
        It's engraved in my heart
