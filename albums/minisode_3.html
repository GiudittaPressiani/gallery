    <h2>I'll See You There Tomorrow</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-tomorrow">"Let's meet tomorrow" is an ordinary greeting and an expression of promise. 
        However, reuniting with the other person tomorrow as promised is actually a magical thing in everyday life. 
        TOMORROW X TOGETHER expressed their desire to keep the words "Let's meet tomorrow" in the song. Yeonjun, Hueningkai, and Taehyun participated in the lyrics, capturing a wistful sensibility. 
        It is a UK-style house genre song with a groovy and sweet melody on a bright and exciting track</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow"><strong>[Verse 1: Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
    Someone like you 이 세상 단 하나
    서로를 길들였지 너와 난
    도망치고 싶던 나에게
    "내일 또 만나" 말해주던 아이

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai, Beomgyu]</strong>
    반짝임에 현혹돼
    네 손을 다 놓친 채
    한참을 헤맨 뒤에
    깨닫게 돼 오랜 너의 한마디

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Taehyun]</strong>
    나는 믿어, we are meant to be
    늦어져도 돼 난 늘 여기
    내일에서 기다릴 테니
    There'll be no more sorrow, I'll see you there tomorrow

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Soobin, Huening Kai, Beomgyu]</strong>
    There'll be no more sorrow, I'll see you there tomorrow
    There'll be no more sorrow, I'll see you there tomorrow
    There'll be no more sorrow, I'll see you there tomorrow
    There'll be no more sorrow, I'll see you there tomorrow

    <strong>[Verse 2: Taehyun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    황금빛 너의 머릿결 땜에
    빛나는 밀밭을 사랑하듯
    너의 발자욱 소리 소리가
    들려오면 난 행복할 거야

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Yeonjun, Huening Kai]</strong>
    그 평범한 약속엔
    흔한 말뿐인데
    매 순간 느낀 설렘
    너로 인해 내게 온 기적 같아

    <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    나는 믿어, we are meant to be
    늦어져도 돼 난 늘 여기
    내일에서 기다릴 테니
    There'll be no more sorrow, I'll see you there tomorrow

    <strong>[Interlude]</strong>
    기다릴 테니
    There'll be no more sorrow, I'll see you there tomorrow
    There'll be no more sorrow, I'll see you there tomorrow
    There'll be no more sorrow, I'll see you there tomorrow

    <strong>[Bridge: Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
    떠올려 봐 너와 내 promise
    반드시 널 알아볼 테니
    내일에서 만나는 우린
    함께 저 너머로, I'll see you there tomorrow

    <strong>[Post-Bridge: Huening Kai, Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    함께 저 너머로, I'll see you there tomorrow
    함께 저 너머로, I'll see you there tomorrow
    함께 저 너머로, I'll see you there tomorrow
    함께 저 너머로, I'll see you there tomorrow (Yeah)</p>

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow">Someone like you, there's one 
    and only in this world
    We tamed each other, you and I 
    The child who said "Let's meet again tomorrow"
    To the me who wanted to run away

    I was deluded by the sparkle, 
    Your hands slipped out of mine 
    After a wandering aimlessly for a long time, 
    I realized
    Your words from a long time ago

    I believe, we are meant to be 
    It's okay if you're late, 
    I'll be always be here waiting at tomorrow

    There'll be no more sorrow
    I'll see you there tomorrow
    There'll be no more sorrow
    I'll see you there tomorrow
    There'll be no more sorrow
    I'll see you there tomorrow
    There'll be no more sorrow
    I'll see you there tomorrow
    There'll be no more sorrow
    I'll see you there tomorrow

    Because of your golden hair, 
    It was like loving a shining wheat field
    Just hearing the sound of your footsteps
    Will make me happy

    In that ordinary promise,
    There were only common words 
    But the excitement that 
    I feel at every moment
    Because of you
    It's like a miracle to me

    I believe, we are meant to be 
    It's okay if you're late, 
    I'll be always be here waiting at tomorrow
    There'll be no more sorrow
    I'll see you there tomorrow

    There'll be no more sorrow 
    I'll see you there tomorrow
    There'll be no more sorrow
    I'll see you there tomorrow
    There'll be no more sorrow
    I'll see you there tomorrow
    There'll be no more sorrow
    I'll see you there tomorrow

    Try to recall, the promise between you and I
    I'll recognize you no matter what
    The "us" we will meet tomorrow
    Will be together till beyond

    I'll see you there tomorrow
    We'll be together till beyond
    I'll see you there tomorrow
    We'll be together till beyond
    I'll see you there tomorrow
    We'll be together till beyond
    I'll see you there tomorrow
    We'll be together till beyond
    I'll see you there tomorrow</p>

    <p class="modal-note-tomorrow">Note: The lyrics contain references to 'The Little Prince' with mentions of things like the taming of the fox, 
        so that they start becoming important to each other and the prince's golden hair.</p>

        'Introduction Film' and 'Questioning Film', and the introduction of the first title song 'One Day a Horn Grew from My Head (CROWN)'. 
        The title of the song 'TOMORROW' means the future we will create together, and the hope and affirmation that the future will exist</p>

    <h2>Deja Vu</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-tomorrow">The title track "Deja Vu" is a pop song that is a hybrid of Rage, a subgenre of trap, and Emo Rock. 
        Producer Bang Si-hyuk and Big Hit Music's exclusive producer Slow Rabbit and Supreme Boi participated in the song's work. 
        You can feel the sophisticated melody and the unique sadness and overwhelming energy of TOMORROW X TOGETHER at the same time. 
        The boy says that just like the promises we made in the past, you and I will definitely meet again, and the moment of reunion will feel like 'déjà vu'. 
        The lyrics reminiscent of TOMORROW X TOGETHER's previous title song are also points to keep an eye on.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow"><strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Huening Kai, *Taehyun*, Beomgyu, Soobin]</strong>
    Yeah, 수없이 도망갔었어, 그저 무서웠었어
    아직 시작에서 기다리는 너를 두고
    폐허 속의 morse code, 오랜 promise, promise
    이유를 모르던 나의 눈물 내 anemoia
    *You and I*, 약속의 별빛 아래서
    *먼지 쌓인* 우리의 왕관 앞에서
    영혼에 새긴 꿈처럼 다시
    영원이 돼줘 나를 불러줘

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Taehyun, Beomgyu, Soobin, Huening Kai]</strong>
    기억해 마침내 찾은 answer
    나의 미래는 너야
    Say my name
    첫날의 약속처럼 널 세게 안을 거야
    마치 déjà vu
    넌 마치 déjà vu
    Say it (Say it), say it (Say it)
    Say it, say it louder

    <strong>[Verse 2: Soobin, Taehyun, Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    나를 태우는 그 불꽃 비 속에
    영겁같이 긴 여행 속에
    너와 나눈 슬픔은 my clarity
    너의 눈물 곁으로
    Oh, 추락해 오는 순간에도 넌 all I need
    무너진 폐허 틈의 너와 나의 place of promise
    안식의 대지 영원의 회귀
    날 기다려 줬던 너

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Huening Kai, Beomgyu, Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    기억해 마침내 찾은 answer
    나의 미래는 너야 (Oh)
    Say my name
    첫날의 약속처럼 널 세게 안을 거야 (No; 거야)
    마치 déjà vu
    넌 마치 déjà vu
    Say it (Say it), say it (Say it)
    Say it, say it louder

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Huening Kai, Beomgyu, Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
    약속해 (해, yeah) 몇 번을 반복해도 (Yeah)
    나의 미래는 너야 (너야)
    빛의 베일에 (Oh-oh)
    신부처럼 반짝일 널 세게 안을 거야 (Oh-oh)
    마치 déjà vu
    넌 마치 déjà vu (너야)
    Say it (Say it), say it (Say it)
    Say it, say it louder (Say it louder)</p>

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow">I ran away countless times
    I was just scared
    Leaving you waiting at the start line</p>

    <p class="modal-note-tomorrow">Note: "I ran away countless times" is a reference to the lyric "I want to run away like this" from 'CROWN' and the theme of running away from 'Run Away' and 'LOSER=LOVER' <br>
    "Leaving you waiting at the start line" could be a reference to the lyric “this place is our start line” from 'Magic Island'</p>

    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow">The morse code amidst the ruins
    An old promise, promise 
    Not knowing the reason of my tears, my anemoia</p>    

    <p class="modal-note-tomorrow">Note: "The morse code" is a reference to the morse code from CROWN and the members' introduction films. <br><br> 
    "Amidst the ruins" is a reference to "Turned into ruins, our memories have become ashes” from 'Can't you see me?' <br> <br>
    "An old promise" refers to the promise that the boys made in the 'Nap of a star' MV, "Even if we part ways, let's meet here again"<br> <br></p>
    
    <p class="modal-note-tomorrow">The theme in the lyric, "Not knowing the reason of my tears, my anemoia" might be the theme seen, in the anime, 'Your Name' as the members mentioned that the company took them 
    to watch the movie when they were trainees, raising speculations that it might be related to their storyline since there are similar references in other songs as well. <br><br>
    The movie starts with the protagonists saying that sometimes they wake up or find themselves crying, without any known reason.
    Anemoia is a term that refers to the nostalgia or longing for a person or a place that one has never known. This is also the base of the plotline of 'Your Name'</p>
    
    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow">You and I, under the starlit promise 
    In front of our crowns covered in dust, 
    Once again, like the dream carved in my soul
    Be my eternity, say my name </p>

    <p class="modal-note-tomorrow">Note: “you and I under the starlit promise” is a reference to the lyric “That eternal promise was like magic, our scintilla bloomed underneath the starlight” from 'Can't you see me?' <br><br>
    “In front of our crowns covered in dust” is a reference to the theme of their debut song, 'CROWN'<br><br>
    “Once again, like the dream carved in my soul” is a reference to the lyric “in this eternal dream that is the deepest, My blue secret that is asleep” from 'Eternally'<br><br>
    “Be my eternity, say my name” is the same exact lyric from the chorus of 'Run Away'</p>

    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow">I remember the answer I finally found
    My future is you

    Say my name
    I'll hug you tight, as promised on first day

    Like deja vu
    You're like deja vu

    Say it, say it 
    Say it, say it louder

    In the flaming rain that's burning me
    Within that long, eternal journey 
    The sadness we shared is my clarity 
    By you tears </p>

    <p class="modal-note-tomorrow">Note: "In the flaming rain that's burning me, Within that long, eternal journey" is a reference to the lyric, "That day when flaming rain came down, That dance that called for a nightmare That rhythm that won't stop" from 'Eternally' <br><br>
    "The sadness we shared is my clarity, By your tears" is a reference to the lyric "Let's make your tears into a spell, So that you'll never cry again" from 'Run Away</p>

    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow">Oh, even when I'm crashing down, you're all I need
    Amid all the ruins, our place of promise 
    The land of rest, the return of eternity 
    You're the one that waited for me</p>
    
    <p class="modal-note-tomorrow">Note: "Even when I'm crashing down, you're all I need" is a reference to the lyric, "If I'm with you, even crashing down is beautiful" from 'LOSER=LOVER' <br><br>
    "Amid all the ruins, our place of promise" is a reference to the lyric "That eternal promise was like magic, Now see them burn in fire, Turned into ruins, our memories turned into ashes" from 'Can't You See Me?' <br><br>
    "The land of rest, the return of eternity" is a reference to Section 5 from the Eternally MV, titled "Moratorium of Rest". In this section, Taehyun is seen calling out to Yeonjun, who he assumes is waiting for him, but Yeonjun is seen unresponsive, covered with flowers and purple blood. This scene is presumably what the following lyric, "You're the one that waited for me" is referencing.</p>

    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow">I remember the answer I finally found
    My future is you

    Say my name
    I'll hug you tight, as promised on first day

    Like deja vu
    You're like deja vu

    Say it, say it 
    Say it, say it louder

    I promise, no matter how many times it repeats
    My future is you

    Under the veil of light
    I'll hug you tight, who's shining like a bride

    Like deja vu
    You're like deja vu
    Say it, say it
    Say it, say it louder</p>

    <p class="modal-note-tomorrow">Note: The theme of 'promise' and 'eternity' have been a recurring theme of TXT's music and universe for the past 5 years. 'Deja Vu, references all these past lyrics to emphasize the feeling of how meeting 'you' again feels like déja vu. 
        This song essentially brings and pieces their whole universe together.</p>

    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow"><strong>[Intro: Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    You
    You (Yeah)

    <strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>
    나 홀로 헤매어 왔어 거울 속의 maze
    기적 따위는 믿지 않던 나
    내일의 태양이 두렵던 내게
    넌 어둠 속 candle light

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Beomgyu]</strong>
    성공, 명예, 돈
    It's nothing without you

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
    두 눈을 감아야 보이는 tomorrow
    One, two, three, 셋 세면 펼쳐져
    One, 너라면, two, 너무나, three
    기다려져 내일이란 기적이

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Beomgyu, Huening Kai]</strong>
    La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
    기다려져 내일이란 기적이

    <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun, Beomgyu, Taehyun]</strong>
    삐끗할 수 있지 어때 뭐
    네가 잡을 테지 나의 손

    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow">I've been wandering alone 
    in this maze in the mirror,
    I didn't believe in things such as miracles
    To me, who was afraid of tomorrow's sun
    You were a candlelight in the darkness</p>

    <p class="modal-note-tomorrow">Note: The first lyric is a reference to the song, 'Maze in the Mirror'</p>

    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow">Success, fame, money

    Two, so very
    Three, I look forward to the 
    miracle that is 'tomorrow"</p>

    I look forward to the miracle that is 'tomorrow'

    We can make missteps, so what?
    You will hold my hand
    So comfortably let our warm take care of you
    On a cold winter day, make it warm
    In the river filled with lights, 
    Our favorite song that we listened to together
    The midnight escape we did on bikes
    They shine on my like a miracle, it's like you
    With that connection, 
    Let's go towards tomorrow

    Only when you close both eyes 
    you can see tomorrow
    One two three, it'll reveal when you count to three

    <h2>The Killa</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-tomorrow">This is a unit song by Soobin and Yeonjun, and it is an Afrobeats genre with a sensual feel. The longing for affection, which cannot be expressed simply with the words 'I love you', 
        is conveyed with the words 'please tame me as yours'. While the powerful lyrics such as "Tame me", "I'll just follow you", and "I belong to ya" are impressive, the catchy and addictive chorus melody is the key point. 
        Taehyun and Yeonjun participated in the lyrics.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow"><strong>[Intro: Soobin]</strong>
    길들여 줘

    <strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>
    점점 더 갈구해
    You know I want you bad
    Show me mercy (Mercy)
    우연 속 운명의 강한 얽힘
    두 눈 속의 서로를 찾은 그 순간
    Want you to tame me now
    웃으며 나를 애태워도 but you're worth it (Worth it)
    무슨 말이냐며 웃는 널
    그저 널 따르겠어 난 serve you
    나를 죽여 (Oh)

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>
    The killa (Oh-oh)
    심장, 영혼까지 다 네 것 (Oh-oh)
    넌 나를 앓게 하는 fever
    마침내 날 제거하길 빌어
    Like champagne (Champagne)
    너무 달콤한 너의 reign on me
    내가 미쳐 널 위해 나를 give up
    흔하디흔한 말 te quiero
    대신 I belong to ya

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    The killa-a-a-a
    길들여 너로 날 fill up (Fill up)
    녹아내려 나는 다 없어져 (없어져)
    난 너의 일부처럼 퍼져
    The killa-a-a-a
    길들여져 너에게 속해 happier
    이건 나만의 te quiero
    I wanna belong to ya

    <strong>[Verse 2: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    오로지 너만이
    나의 짙은 결핍 위의 everything
    날 지배하고
    그대 권능 아래 거두리
    You are the only one I want
    이 순간 네 손아귀에 틀어쥔
    내 영혼은
    The killa 너의 것, 영원히 yours (Yours)

    <strong>[Verse 3: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    You, you, you
    죄책감 따위 you don't need it
    모든 죗값 내 몫이니
    넌 그저 날 가지면 돼
    Baby, now, now, now, now
    Yes, I belong to you
    희열 속의 죽음 round two
    영원을 네게 바쳐 난 serve it
    나를 죽여 (Oh)

    <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    The killa (Oh-oh)
    심장, 영혼까지 다 네 것 (Oh-oh)
    넌 나를 앓게 하는 fever
    마침내 날 제거하길 빌어
    Like champagne (Champagne)
    너무 달콤한 너의 reign on me
    내가 미쳐 널 위해 나를 give up
    흔하디흔한 말 te quiero
    대신 I belong to ya

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>

    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow">Tame me

    I'm slowing craving for more
    You know I want you bad
    Show me mercy
    The powerful entanglement of fate within coincidence
    That, moment where we look for each other within our eyes

    Want you to tame me now
    Even it you laugh and make me impatient,
    But you're worth it
    You, who laughs while asking what I
    mean
    I'll only obey you, I serve you
    You kill me

    The killa
    My heart and my soul are all yours
    You're like a fever that makes me sick
    I hope you'll finally get rid of me

    Like champagne,
    Your reign on me is too sweet
    I'm going crazy, I give me up 
    to you foryour sake
    It's such a common phrase, 
    te quiero Instead (I'll say), 
    I belong to ya

    The killa
    Tame me, fill me up with you I'm melting, 
    I completely disappear I
    seep through like a part of you 
    The killa
    I'm getting tamed, I'm happier within you 
    This is my own te quiero 
    I wanna belong to ya

    Only you are
    Everything on top of my immense weakness
    You dominate me
    I reap under your authority
    You are the only one I want
    My soul
    That you seize in your hands at this moment
    The killa, it's yours, forever yours

    You, you, you
    you don't need it, a sense of guilt
    All the guilt is my burden
    You just need to have me
    Baby now now now now
    Yes, I belong to you
    Death within ecstasy round 2
    I offer you an eternity, I serve it 
    Kill me

    The killa
    My heart and my soul are all yours
    You're like a fever that makes me sick
    I hope you'll finally get rid of me

    Like champagne,
    Your reign on me is too sweet
    I'm going crazy, I give me up to you for your sake
    It's such a common phrase,

    <h2>Quarter Life</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-tomorrow">Bumgyu, Taehyun, and Hueningkai's unit song. It is a medium-tempo Stadium Rock song that conveys the energy of youth from the melody in the chorus. 
        It is a song that captures TOMORROW X TOGETHER's mindset of dealing with the Quarter-life Crisis felt at the point of one-quarter of their lives. 
        Even if you are trapped in a tunnel with no exit, the will to live without giving up gives you a sense of strength. Taehyun and Soobin participated in the lyrics.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow"><strong>[Verse 1: Beomgyu, Huening Kai]</strong>
    A quarter life
    누군가가 나의 나이를 부르는 말
    사분의 일쯤 걸어온 긴긴 터널
    너무 긴긴 터널
    좋을 때래
    아름다운 청춘은 지금뿐이래
    힘들기만 한데 I ain't happy at all
    I ain't happy at all

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Taehyun]</strong>
    혹시 어두운 이 터널에도 끝은 있을까?
    소리쳐도 메아리뿐이야

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
    어디로 가야 하는 건데?
    답이 없는 참견 사이에
    Lonely 홀로 남겨진 채
    제자리를 걷는 듯해, quarter life crisis
    출구 없이 던져진 삶에
    끝을 모르겠는 이 길에
    매일이 너무나 막막해
    제자리를 걷는 듯해, quarter life crisis

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: All, Huening Kai]</strong>
    Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
    Quarter life crisis
    Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
    Quarter life crisis

    <strong>[Verse 2: Taehyun]</strong>
    Don't wanna say
    아무리 나 힘들어도 don't wanna say
    이번 생은 망했다고 I fucked it up
    Won't say "I fucked it up," no

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Beomgyu]</strong>
    어쩜 지금이 제일 깜깜한 지점일지 몰라
    지금 멈춰 서지는 말자

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
    어디로 가야 하는 건지?
    모르겠지만 걷는 거지
    당장은 좀 깜깜해도
    헤매듯 헤쳐 나가 quarter life crisis
    Don't look back, 돌아갈 순 없지
    어른이란 건 어쩜 사실
    정답이 꼭 없는 답지
    헤매듯 헤쳐 나가 quarter life crisis

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: All, Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
    Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
    Quarter life crisis
    Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
    Quarter life crisis
    Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
    Quarter life crisis
    Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
    헤매듯 헤쳐 나가 quarter life crisis

    <strong>[Outro: Beomgyu, Huening Kai]</strong>
    어디로 가야 하는 건지?
    모르겠지만 걷는 거지
    당장은 좀 깜깜해도
    헤매듯 헤쳐 나가 quarter life crisis</p>

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow">A quarter life
    It's the phrase someone calls my age
    The long long tunnel that I've walked about a quarter ot
    It's such a long long tunnel

    They say these are the good times
    They say my beautiful youth is only now 
    It's only tough though, 
    I ain't happy at all 
    I ain't happy at all

    I wonder if even this dark tunnel has an end 
    Even if I shout, there's only an echo
    Where do I have to go?
    In between these unanswered interferences,
    Lonely, I'm left all alone
    It's like I'm walking in circles, quarter life
    crisis

    In this life that was thrown at me without any exits,
    I don't know the end of this path, 
    Everyday is so suffocating
    It's like I'm walking in circles, quarter life crisis

    Quarter life crisis
    Quarter life crisis

    Don't wanna say
    No matter how hard it is, 
    I don't wanna say 
    That I messed up this life, 
    I fucked it up 
    Won't say "I fucked it up"

    This moment might be the darkest period, we don't know
    Let's not stop right now
    I don't know where we need to go 
    But we'll walk forward
    It might be a bit dark now
    But we'll pull through as if we're wandering, quarter life crisis

    Don't look back, you can't turn back time
    Becoming an adult might just be
    An answer sheet with no right answer
    But we'll pull through as if we're wandering, quarter life crisis

    Quarter life crisis
    Quarter life crisis
    Quarter life crisis
    But we'll pull through as if we're wandering, quarter life crisis

    I don't know where we need to go 
    But we'll walk forward
    It might be a bit dark now
    But we'll pull through as if we're wandering, quarter life crisis</p>

    <p class="modal-songs-description-tomorrow">This is an alternative rock remix version of the title track 'Deja Vu' reconstructed with an acoustic guitar as the center. 
        The arrangement was made so that you could focus on the lyrics and melody, maximizing the lyrical feeling of the song. Like the lyrics of 'Anemoia' (nostalgia for 
        a time when you haven't experienced), you can convey expectations for the speaker's encounter, which feels like an old future.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-tomorrow"><strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Huening Kai, *Taehyun*, Beomgyu, Soobin]</strong>
    Yeah, 수없이 도망갔었어, 그저 무서웠었어
    아직 시작에서 기다리는 너를 두고
    폐허 속의 morse code, 오랜 promise, promise
    이유를 모르던 나의 눈물 내 anemoia
    *You and I*, 약속의 별빛 아래서
    *먼지 쌓인* 우리의 왕관 앞에서
    영혼에 새긴 꿈처럼 다시
    영원이 돼줘 나를 불러줘

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Taehyun, Beomgyu, Soobin, Huening Kai]</strong>
    기억해 마침내 찾은 answer
    나의 미래는 너야
    Say my name
    첫날의 약속처럼 널 세게 안을 거야
    마치 déjà vu
    넌 마치 déjà vu
    Say it (Say it), say it (Say it)
    Say it, say it louder

    <strong>[Verse 2: Soobin, Taehyun, Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    나를 태우는 그 불꽃 비 속에
    영겁같이 긴 여행 속에
    너와 나눈 슬픔은 my clarity
    너의 눈물 곁으로
    Oh, 추락해 오는 순간에도 넌 all I need
    무너진 폐허 틈의 너와 나의 place of promise
    안식의 대지 영원의 회귀
    날 기다려 줬던 너

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Huening Kai, Beomgyu, Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    기억해 마침내 찾은 answer
    나의 미래는 너야 (Oh)
    Say my name
    첫날의 약속처럼 널 세게 안을 거야 (No; 거야)
    마치 déjà vu
    넌 마치 déjà vu
    Say it (Say it), say it (Say it)
    Say it, say it louder

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Huening Kai, Beomgyu, Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
    약속해 (해, yeah) 몇 번을 반복해도 (Yeah)
    나의 미래는 너야 (너야)
    빛의 베일에 (Oh-oh)
    신부처럼 반짝일 널 세게 안을 거야 (Oh-oh)
    마치 déjà vu
    넌 마치 déjà vu (너야)
    Say it (Say it), say it (Say it)
    Say it, say it louder (Say it louder)</p>
