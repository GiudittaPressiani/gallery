        <p>The Name Chapter: FREEFALL is a story of the youth who had been delaying their adulthood and escaping from the world but finally decided to face reality. 
            The process of freefalling into reality is tormenting, and reality bites, but they make a firm determination to go on, facing up to everything around them. <br>
            TOMORROW X TOGETHER's resplendent coming-of-age story is anticipated to offer comfort and empathy to all of those moving toward their dreams</p>

    <h2>GROWING PAIN</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freefall">It is a metal-based hard rock genre song. The dynamic drums and rough-textured distortion guitar are attractive, and the explosive melody and the tone of TOMORROW X TOGETHER maximize the dreamy atmosphere and immersion. 
        The first thing he encountered on the journey to reality from the beautiful but irresponsible paradise was the pain that came at the moment of the downhill. The boy decides to accept even this pain as growing pains. 
        Yeonjun, Taehyun, and Hueningkai participated in the lyrics.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-freefall"><strong>[Verse 1: Huening Kai, Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Been free falling
    허공 속으로
    낙원의 끝 절벽 아래
    Don't know how to fly but I'm gonna try to let go
    온몸을 다 할퀴는
    날카로운 air
    중력은 날 끌어당기네
    Don't know how to fly but I'm gonna try to let go

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Beomgyu, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    어린 시절의 꿈
    끝없는 낙하 성장의 증거
    깨면 끝이 났던 그 꿈과는 달라
    온몸이 아파, there's no way to stop
    I throw myself, throw myself, throw myself
    Free falling, falling, falling, say

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
    (Ooh) 떨어져 끝없이
    (Ooh) 기꺼이 go low
    고통 속으로
    던져버려, body, yeah
    (Ooh) 부딪혀 겁 없이
    (Ooh) 곤두박질쳐
    현실 속으로
    던져버려, body, yeah

    <strong>[Verse 2: Huening Kai, Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    눈을 떠
    저기 땅을 보렴
    피하지 마 절대
    You just gotta face it
    피가 흐르고
    뼈가 부러진대도
    Gotta make my way through this
    I'm falling

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    (Ooh) 떨어져 끝없이
    (Ooh) 기꺼이 go low
    고통 속으로
    던져버려, body, yeah
    (Ooh) 부딪혀 겁 없이
    (Ooh) 곤두박질쳐
    현실 속으로
    던져버려, body, yeah

    <strong>[Bridge: Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Go
    후횐 없어 (후횐 없어)
    거짓 없는 꿈에 나를 던져
    I'm falling

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
    (Ooh) 떨어져 끝없이
    (Ooh) 기꺼이 go low
    고통 속으로
    던져버려, body, yeah
    (Ooh) 부딪혀 겁 없이
    (Ooh) 곤두박질쳐
    현실 속으로
    던져버려, body, yeah</p>

    <h2>CHASING THAT FEELING</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freefall">It is a new wave genre with a 1980s sensibility, and its speedy melody, heavy beat, and synthesizer sound make good use of TOMORROW X TOGETHER's unique style. 
    It is a song that leaves behind the sweet but ungrowth past and announces a new beginning in reality. Unlike the romantic and hopeful hymns of youth, 
    TOMORROW X TOGETHER openly reveals and confronts the pain, anxiety, and even the emptiness of reality, raising the consensus of young people in this era.</p>

    <p class="lyrics-freefall"><strong>[Verse 1: Beomgyu, Yeonjun]</strong>
    천국을 등진 난
    Fall from the sky
    Maybe I'll miss it for good
    달콤했던 환각
    고통이 살갗에
    I prepared to die
    더 속력을 높여서
    Down to earth like a meteorite

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun, Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    내 숙명아, come and kiss me
    I just keep on chasing that feeling
    망가진 나여도 leave me
    I just keep on chasing, chasing that
    Feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    It's all I know, it's all I know

    <strong>[Verse 2: Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    길을 잃었던 나의 시간
    I was lost like a child
    비로소 진실을 봤어, yeah
    And I feel so alive
    내 몸의 growing pains
    Feels like I'm on fire
    조금 아파도
    Burn and fall like a shooting star

    <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    내 숙명아, come and kiss me
    I just keep on chasing that feeling
    망가진 나여도 leave me
    I just keep on chasing, chasing that

    I'm chasing
    Chasing
    I'm chasing

    <strong>[Bridge: Yeonjun]</strong>
    천국을 등진 난
    Fall from the sky
    And everything's gonna be alright, alright, alright

    내 숙명아, come and kiss me
    I just keep on chasing that feeling

    Feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    It's all I know, it's all I know

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>

    <h2>DO IT LIKE THAT</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freefall">A summer song with a danceable track with a funky bass line. The lyrics and melody express the ecstatic moment of falling in love are impressive, and the synthesizers, claps, and upbeat percussion sounds are combined to create excitement. 
        While the lyrics filled with happiness enliven the entire song, the catchy chorus is so catchy that anyone can sing along from the first note is attractive.</p>

    <h2>CHASING THAT FEELING (English Version)</h2>
    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-freefall"><strong>[Verse 1: Beomgyu, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Lost on a moonlit night
    Summer, one-nine
    Thought it would last forever
    Never felt more alive
    Life was so simple then
    A perpetual high
    Those days that I knew may be gone
    But I won't let them die

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun, Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Time's a thief that keeps on stealing
    I just keep on chasing that feeling
    Won't give up, won't stop believing
    I just keep on chasing, chasing that
    Feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    It's all I know, it's all I know

    <strong>[Verse 2: Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Didn't know what I had, did I?
    Left it all in the past
    Hoping for twice in a lifetime
    Is that too much to ask?
    Lightning across the sky
    Went by in a flash
    I'll keep running faster
    Chasing one more chance

    <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    Time's a thief that keeps on stealing
    I just keep on chasing that feeling
    Won't give up, won't stop believing
    I just keep on chasing, chasing that
    Feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    It's all I know, it's all I know

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Huening Kai]</strong>
    I'm chasing
    Chasing
    I'm chasing

    <strong>[Bridge: Yeonjun]</strong>
    In my kaleidoscopе
    Are pressed butterflies
    Reminding me I've only one life

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Beomgyu, Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
    Time's a thief that keeps on stealing
    I just keep on chasing that feeling
    Won't give up, won't stop believing
    I just keep on chasing, chasing that
    Feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    It's all I know, it's all I know

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    I keep chasing, chasing
    I'm chasing
    Chasing
    Chasing that feeling</p>

    <h2>BACK FOR MORE (ft. ANITTA)</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freefall">Back for More (with Anitta) is a song that says that magical miracle moments exist in everyday life, and for me, reunion with 'you' will be such a moment. 
        Unlike the bright and cheerful atmosphere that Tomorrow By Together used to have a bright and cheerful atmosphere in disco songs, the sexy charm stands out in this song</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-freefall"><strong>[Intro: Beomgyu]</strong>
    I can see you comin' back for more
    Comin' back for more, ayy
    If you walk out that door

    <strong>[Verse 1: Taehyun, Huening Kai]</strong>
    When I'm with you, it all feels different
    When I'm with you, it all makes sense
    And I know you don't feel no different
    Woah-ooh
    There's a magic to how we livin'
    There's a magic to what this is
    It's like a dream and we both day-trippin'
    Woah-ooh

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>
    All I know is if you walk away
    There'll be something
    There'll be things you can't replace
    All I know is if you walk away
    There'll be something
    Baby, that's okay, 'cause

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    I can see you comin' back for more
    Comin' back for more (Yeah)
    If you walk out that door
    I can see you comin' back for more (Can you?)
    Comin' back for more (Yeah)
    If you walk out that door

    <strong>[Verse 2: Anitta, Yeonjun]</strong>
    I don't wanna feel nobody
    If it isn't you, baby
    Contigo me pongo naughty
    Been thinking about you lately
    Ita, ita
    Loco como mueve el culo, Anitta
    De todas yo soy la favorita
    Tú estás pa' mí y yo pa' ti todita
    Pa-pa-pam-pam, pam-pam-pam-pam
    I know what you like, sing it like
    Pa-pa-pam-pam, pam-pam-pam-pam
    Esto va a empezar (Oh)

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Taehyun, Anitta]</strong>
    All I know is if you walk away
    There'll be something (Something)
    Baby, that's okay, 'cause

    <strong>[Chorus: Beomgyu, Beomgyu & Anitta, Soobin, Anitta, *Taehyun*]</strong>
    I can see you comin' back for more
    Comin' back for more (Hey)
    If you walk out that door
    I can see you comin' back for more (I can see you, *Ooh-ooh, ow*)
    Comin' back for more (*Got me back for more, ah*)
    If you walk out that door (*Come on*; Door, oh)

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Taehyun, Taehyun & Anitta, Huening Kai, Anitta]</strong>
    When I'm with you, it all feels different
    When I'm with you, when I'm with you (No)
    I can see you comin' back for more (Oh, oh)
    Comin' back for more
    If you walk out that—</p>
