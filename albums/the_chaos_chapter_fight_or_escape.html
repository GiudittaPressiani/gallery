        <p>The 'Chaos Chapter' depicts a world in which dreams have been swept away to be replaced by the towering presence of reality. As the world he once knew crumbles away, the boy feels small, insignificant, empty, and frozen. But 'you' awaken the emotion of 'love' inside of him, and the boy now seeks to step out beyond the freeze. For 'you', he wants to make a choice: to FIGHT against the world or to ESCAPE together with you.
        The Chaos Chapter: FIGHT OR ESCAPE consists of eleven tracks total, eight of which were previously released through The Chaos Chapter: FREEZE. The repackaged album debuts three new tracks: "LO$ER=LO♡ER", "MOA Diary ( Dubaddu Wari Wari )", and "0X1=LOVESONG ( I Know I Love You ) feat. Seori ( Emocore Mix )."<br>

    <h2>LO$ER = LO&#9825;ER</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-fight">A song in the Aunt pop-punk genre. It delivers explosive energy with an addictive melody and a group song filled with youthful energy. 
        Although it looks like a 'loser' from the world's point of view, it is a song that expresses the boy's desire to become a 'lover' who saves each other for 'you', the only world and savior. 
        The guitar loop at the intro, which is filled with a melancholic and lyrical feeling, the explosive energy rap written by Yeonjun, and the lyrics that describe the dream of escaping from a world where it is difficult to find hope, have released the emotions that Generation Z feels in real life in their own style, completing another TOMORROW X TOGETHER love song.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-fight"><strong>[Intro: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    I'm a loser, I'm a loser
    Ayy
    Oh, yeah, yeah

    <strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
    회색빛 차를 타고 달아나고 있어
    빌어먹을 세상 너머 (Oh, oh)
    네 손을 잡은 내 손 상처뿐이지만
    It doesn't matter when I'm with you

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Beomgyu, Taehyun]</strong>
    이길 수 없던 fighting, bleeding, losing 이젠 지쳤어
    가질 수 없다면 I fuckin' keep it low
    Crying, crying, crying 이젠 집어쳐
    Love you, love you, love you no matter what I do

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun, All]</strong>
    I say run
    미친 듯 크게 웃어줘
    눈물은 이제 good bye
    Time to say
    Run
    절대 뒤돌아보지 마
    두 손엔 hundred bands
    I'm a loser

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Yeonjun, All, Beomgyu]</strong>
    I'm a loser (Oh-oh)
    I'm a loser (Oh-oh)
    Lover with a dollar sign
    Is a loser
    I'm a lover (Oh-oh)
    I'm a lover (Oh-oh)
    Lover with a dollar sign
    Is a loser

    <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun, Beomgyu, Taehyun]</strong>
    전쟁 같은 life 지기만 했었던 나
    넌 내 구원이었어 (No doubt, no doubt, no doubt)
    벼랑 끝에서 너의 빛이 나를 이끌어
    Making me a winner (So right, so right, so right)

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Huening Kai]</strong>
    밑바닥에서 crawling, fighting, bleeding 이젠 지쳤어
    거절하겠다면 I fuckin' take it all
    Crying, crying, crying 이젠 집어쳐
    Love you, love you, love you, no matter what I do

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Huening Kai, All]</strong>
    I say run
    미친 듯 크게 웃어줘
    눈물은 이제 good bye
    Time to say
    Run
    절대 뒤돌아보지 마
    두 손엔 hundred bands
    I'm a loser

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Beomgyu, All, Soobin]</strong>
    I'm a loser (Oh-oh)
    I'm a loser (Oh-oh)
    Lover with a dollar sign
    Is a loser
    I'm a lover (Oh-oh)
    I'm a lover (Oh-oh)
    Lover with a dollar sign
    Is a loser

    <strong>[Verse 3: Yeonjun]</strong>
    뛰어내려 from this highway (Way, way, way)
    펼친 채 부러진 날개 (날개)
    영원을 향해 flyin'
    안간힘 써봐도 추락해
    너와 함께라면 (너와 함께라면)
    추락도 아름다워
    하늘의 반대편으로
    기꺼이 나 가라앉아
    그저 서로를 안아줬으면 해
    내 어설픈 비행 끝날 때쯤엔
    모두가 날 비웃어도 I don't care
    가라앉고 싶어 너의 바다에

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun, All]</strong>
    I say run (Run)
    미친 듯 크게 웃어줘 (웃어줘)
    눈물은 이제 good bye
    Time to say
    Run
    절대 뒤돌아보지 마
    두 손엔 hundred bands
    I'm a loser

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Beomgyu, All, Soobin]</strong>
    I'm a loser (Oh-oh)
    I'm a loser (Oh-oh)
    Lover with a dollar sign
    Is a loser
    I'm a lover (Oh-oh)
    I'm a lover (Oh-oh)
    Lover with a dollar sign
    Is a loser</p>

    <p class="lyrics-fight">I'm a LO$ER I'm a LO$ER

    Riding a grey-colored car
    I'm running away
    Past this damn world
    My hand that holds yours
    Only has wounds
    It doesn't matter when I'm with you

    The fighting, bleeding, losing that couldn't be won, I'm tired of it now
    If I can't have it I f** kin' keep it low
    Crying, crying, crying now shove it away
    Love you love you love you
    No matter what I do

    I say “Run”
    Laugh out loud like you're crazy
    The tears, now good bye, time to say
    “Run”
    Never look back
    In both your hands, hunnit bands
    I'm a LO$ER

    I'm a LO$ER I'm a LO$ER
    Lover with a $ dollar sign
    Is a LO$ER
    I'm a LO♡ER I'm a LO♡ER
    Lover with a $ dollar sign
    Is a LO$ER

    This war-like life
    I always only lost
    You were my savior
    No doubt no doubt no doubt
    At the edge of the cliff
    Your light guided me
    Making me a winner
    So right so right so right

    Crawling, fighting, bleeding on the ground, now I'm tired
    If you're going to decline, I f**kin' take it all
    Crying, crying, crying, now shove it away
    Love you love you love you
    No matter what I do

    I say “Run”
    Laugh out loud like you're crazy
    The tears, now good bye, time to say
    “Run”

    Lover with a $ dollar sign
    Is a LO$ER
    I'm a LO♡ER I'm a LO♡ER
    Lover with a $ dollar sign
    Is a LO$ER

    Jump off from this highway
    These wings that broke while being spread out
    Towards 'forever', 'flyin'
    No matter how much I try, I crash
    If I'm with you
    Crashing is also beautiful
    On the other side of the sky
    I'll gladly sink down
    I just want us to hug each other
    Around the time that my clumsy flight ends
    Even if everyone laughs at me, I don't care
    I want to sink down in your ocean

    I say “Run”
    Laugh out loud like you're crazy
    The tears, now good bye, time to say
    “Run”
    Never look back
    In both your hands, hunnit bands
    I'm a LO$ER

    I'm a LO$ER I'm a LO$ER
    Lover with a $ dollar sign
    Is a LO$ER
    I'm a LO♡ER I'm a LO♡ER

    <h2>ANTI-ROMANTIC</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-fight">The song "Anti Romantic", which marks the beginning of "Chaos Chapter: FREEZE", is an electronic pop genre that allows you to feel an emotional and energetic atmosphere at the same time. 
        It tells the story of 'I', who calls himself an 'Anti Romantic' because he wants to stay away from love that only hurts him even if he puts his whole heart into it, but in the end, he cannot prevent his feelings for 'you' from developing, so he is conflicted. 
        The song's emotional line, which begins with boyish vocals and a clear electric piano, and deepens with the addition of strong rhythmic instruments and synthesizers, is attractive.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-fight"><strong>[Verse 1: Taehyun, Huening Kai]</strong>
        I don't know who loves me
        And I don't care 어차피 낭비
        설렘 따위
        좀 겁이 나니까
        달콤 쌉쌀한 chocolate
        끝 맛은 항상 같지
        Like saddest movies
        눈가엔 눈물만

        <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>
        난 알아 달콤한 love song
        맹세의 그 말도
        돌아서면 결국
        낯선 그 someone

        <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Soobin, Huening Kai, Beomgyu]</strong>
        Sorry, I'm an anti-romantic
        달아나고 싶어 저 멀리
        이미 널 쫓는 내 마음이
        작은 불씨로 타올라
        Sorry, I'm an anti-romantic
        더는 믿지 않아, romantic
        내 맘 전부를 다 불사르고
        까만 재만 남게 될까 두려워

        <strong>[Post-Chorus: Taehyun]</strong>
        La-la-la, la-la-la
        La-la-la, ah-ah-ah
        Ah-ah-ah

        <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
        I know that you love me
        또 취하게 해 깊이
        넌 마치 champagne
        이럼 안되는데
        다 보이잖아 끝이
        숙취보다 지독히
        힘들 거잖아
        자, 이쯤에서 끝내

        <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai, Soobin]</strong>
        So stupid, 달콤한 love song
        사치스러운 rom-com
        행복했던 만큼
        계산서엔 red line

        <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Yeonjun, Huening Kai, Soobin]</strong>
        Sorry, I'm an anti-romantic

        이미 널 쫓는 내 마음이

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-fight">I don't know who loves me
        And I don't care, it's a waste anyway
        This romantic feeling
        I feel a little scared
        Sweet and bitter chocolate
        The ending taste is always the same
        Like saddest movies
        On my eyes, only tears

        I know
        Sweet love song
        The word of pledge
        Once you turn around
        They're a stranger, that someone

        Sorry I'm an anti-romantic
        I want to run far away
        Already, my heart that chases you
        Burns up in a small flame
        Sorry I'm an anti-romantic
        I don't trust it anymore, romantic
        That my heart will all burn away
        And only black soot will be left, I'm afraid

        I know that you love me
        It makes me deeply drunk again
        You're like a champagne
        This can't happen
        It can all be seen, the end
        It's more intense than a hangover
        It will be difficult
        Now, let's end it here

        So stupid
        Sweet love song
        Wasteful rom com
        As much as I was happy
        At the cashier, red line

        Sorry I'm an anti-romantic
        I want to run far away
        Already, my heart that chases you
        Burns up in a small flame
        Sorry I'm an anti-romantic

    <p class="modal-songs-description-fight">The title song '0X1=LOVESONG (I Know I Love You) feat. Seori' is an energetic song based on hybrid pop rock, which sings about the 'self-assured' love of a boy who believes that his love for you is as certain as the love he met in the chaos. 
        It is a story about meeting a girl (1) who approaches a boy with a hole (0) in his soul in a world where everything is zero, and the lyrics that seem to express a scene from a youth movie, the progression of dramatic songs, the rough yet delicate vocals of the members, and the featuring of Seori with a dreamy voice combine to leave a strong aftertaste. 
        American singer-songwriters and rock hip-hop artists Mod Sun and No Love For The Middle Child participated in the songwriting, while BTS's RM participated in the lyrics.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-fight"><strong>[Intro: Taehyun]</strong>
        I know I love you

        <strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Beomgyu, Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
        이 제로의 세계 속
        I know you're my one and only (And only; And only)
        이 끝이 없던 어둠 속
        Like oh my god, so holy (So holy)
        뭐든 내 두 손끝에선 (끝에선)
        부리나케 도망가 멀리
        My life before you was a mess
        언제나 단 한 판 이길 수 없던 chess, oh, we

        <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
        무저갱의 바닥에서 (서)
        넌 유일하게 빛나던 gold (Gold)
        Now I can't stop thinking 'bout you
        When I'm sinking alone
        어느 날 내게 나타난 천사 (난 천사)
        데려가 줘 너의 hometown (너의 hometown)
        I know it's real, I can feel it

        <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
        난 문제 투성이 love sick
        길이 없었어
        죽어도 좋았어
        I'm a loser in this game (This game)
        세계의 유일한 법칙
        나를 구해줘
        내 손을 잡아줘
        Please use me like a drug (I know I love you)

        <strong>[Post-Chorus: Seori & Beomgyu, Taehyun, Seori & Yeonjun]</strong>
        Say you love me, say you love me
        세계의 끝까지
        All or nothing, I want all of you
        I know I love you
        Say you love me, say you love me
        세계의 끝까지
        All or nothing, I give all of you
        I know I love you

        <strong>[Verse 2: Soobin, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
        아마 난 안될 거야
        천국엔 못 갈 거야
        어울리지 않아
        자리 따위 천국엔 없어
        뭐든 내 두 발끝에선 (끝에선)
        새까맣게 물들었었지
        My life before you was trash
        언제나 단 한 발 붙일 수 없던 match, oh, we

        <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Beomgyu, Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
        얼음뿐인 이곳에서 (서)
        넌 유일하게 빛나던 glow (Glow)
        Now I can't stop thinking 'bout you
        When I'm sinking alone (Sinking alonе)
        그러다 내게 나타난 천사 (난 천사)
        데려가 줘 너의 hometown (너의 hometown)
        I know it's real, I can feel it

        <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
        난 문제 투성이 love sick
        길이 없었어
        죽어도 좋았어 (Oh)
        I'm a loser in this game (This game)
        세계의 유일한 법칙
        나를 구해줘
        내 손을 잡아줘 (잡아줘)
        Please use me like a drug (I know I love you)

        <strong>[Bridge: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
        구멍 난 영혼에 살이 돋아
        추운 대기가 녹아가
        제로의 세계 속에 찾아낸 너라는 온기
        내 모두를 거둬가, girl, I need you

        <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
        난 문제 투성이 love sick (Oh)
        길이 없었어
        죽어도 좋았어 (좋았어)
        I'm a loser in this game (Game)
        세계의 유일한 법칙
        나를 구해줘 (나를 구해줘)
        내 손을 잡아줘 (내 손을 잡아줘)
        Please use me like a drug (I know I love you)

        <strong>[Post-Chorus: Seori & Beomgyu, Taehyun, Seori & Soobin, Huening Kai]</strong>
        Say you love me, say you love me
        세계의 끝까지 (I love you)
        All or nothing, I want all of you
        I know I love you (You)
        Say you love me, say you love me

    <p class="lyrics-fight">I know I love you

        In this world of zero
        I know you're my 1 & only
        In this endless night
        Like oh my god, so holy
        Whatever, at the tips of my two hands
        It quickly run far away
        My life before you was a mess
        Always, a chess game that I couldn't win even once
        Oh we

        At the bottom of the abyss
        You were a gold that uniquely shone
        Now I can't stop thinking bout you
        When I'm sinking alone
        An angel that appeared before me one day
        Bring me to your hometown
        I know it's real I can feel like

        I'm filled with troubles, love sick
        There was no road
        It was okay if I died
        I'm a loser in this game

        My life before you was trash
        Always a match that you couldn't light a single one

        Girl I need you

    <h2>MAGIC</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-fight">This is the first English song released by TOMORROW X TOGETHER since their debut. It is a cheerful and trendy disco-pop genre that depicts the story of a magical you who melts me from being frozen. 
        It is a cheerful and refreshing song that stands out for its chorus melody that you won't forget even if you listen to it once and the part where you can clap and sing along. 
        In particular, the dynamic performance of "Magic Moves", a choreography that expresses the appearance of magic scattering in the sky with hand gestures, attracts attention with dynamic performances.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-fight"><strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Taehyun]</strong>
        Remember how I used to be so
        Stuck in one place so cold
        Feeling like my heart just froze
        Nowhere to go with no one, nobody
        Suddenly you came through
        Making me make a move
        Nobody got it like you
        I can't look away, I can't

        <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai, Beomgyu]</strong>
        'Cause baby, you're a real one, real one
        Teaching me to feel something so strong (Strong)
        We could reach out and grab it

        <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin, Huening Kai]</strong>
        Oh, it's just like magic
        Feeling your touch, oh, it's a rush
        No one else has it
        Oh, just like magic (Just like magic)
        Oh, it's just like magic
        Holding me tight
        Giving me life

        <strong>[Verse 2: Huening Kai, Beomgyu, Yeonjun]</strong>
        Used to be so afraid
        'Fraid of all the games we played
        Waited around all day
        Nowhere to go with no one, nobody
        Hoping someone would save me

        Something in me just changed
        Got me awake, got me

    <h2>ICE CREAM (SMALL BUT EVIL HAPPINESS)</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-fight">It is a song in the minimalist dance-pop genre, and it deals with 'small evil deeds', which are happiness brought about by small and slightly mean thoughts, rather than 'small deeds', which are small but certain happiness. 
        In an era where happiness itself seems a bit selfish, he humorously unravels his honest feelings with villainous lyrics, a synth bass sound that catches his ears, and a sly and relaxed vocal style. 
        Member Soobin participated in the lyrics.</p>

    <h2>WHAT IF I HAD BEEN THAT PUMA</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-fight">It is an attractive hip-hop song with a trendy atmosphere created by dreamy synthesizers and refreshing piano sounds, and you can feel the different charm of TOMORROW X TOGETHER. 
        The story of the choices faced in life is expressed in comparison to a balance game where you have to choose only one of the two, raising consensus. It takes the setting of 'The Cougar Escaped from the Zoo' from TOMORROW X TOGETHER's second mini-album 'Dream Chapter: ETERNITY' and looks back on 'what choice I would have made if it were that cougar' from the perspective of a domesticated boy. 
        Members Yeonjun, Taehyun, and Beomgyu participated in the lyrics.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-fight"><strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    Pick your 답 A or B, balance game 앞 퓨마와
    Uh, 난 골라야만 하는 걸까
    Uh, 그 물음 앞에서 난
    Yeah, 꿀 먹은 듯 벙어리
    Tricky한 선택의 팔레트 중 몰라 내 색
    고민의 연속 어둠 속의 end
    I need you to tell me if you feel the same
    I need you to tell me

    <strong>[Verse 1: Soobin, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    My EXP 여전히 zero (Zero)
    낯선 곳은 싫어 never ever (Ever)
    뭘 골라야 what's good for me?
    답이 없는 matter
    저기 문밖 아른대는 해방감 (Run away!)
    Ayy, ayy, 마주하는 순간 (Throw it up!)
    사방엔 온통 내 chaser
    조심해 삽시간에 퍼져 골라 봐 believer or saver

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Jaded 끝없는 이 게임에
    느껴지는 headache 이젠
    뭐가 됐든 간에 I don't care
    I just wanna skip it

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Pick your 답 A or B, balance game 앞 퓨마와
    난 골라야만 하는 걸까
    그 물음 앞에서 난
    꿀 먹은 듯 벙어리
    Tricky한 선택의 팔레트 중 몰라 내 색
    고민의 연속 어둠 속의 end
    머릿속 반복되는 얼음 땡
    I just want a 답

    <strong>[Refrain: Beomgyu, Soobin]</strong>
    갈림길 위 어리버리
    확률은 fifty-fifty
    내 선택이 곧 현실
    어느 쪽도 난 안 확실
    눈 감고 guess it, guess it
    A 와 B 사이 내 choices
    나을지도 복불복이
    말처럼 마냥 not easy

    <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun, Taehyun]</strong>
    뭘까 정답이 없을지도
    묻는다면 없어 이유
    말은 잘하지 그럴듯하게 전부
    그럼 come and bet 인생이라면 can you?
    맞는 답은 없어 왜 지어 단정
    딜레마 속으로 풍덩 난 또 빠져
    이렇겐 low key 으 못 살아
    그만 내 머리는 이미 과부하

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Beomgyu]</strong>
    Maybe 나였다면 stay in
    동물원 but can't guess 그때의
    뭐였을까 퓨마의 feelings
    I don't know, just skip it

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
    Pick your 답 A or B, balance game 앞 퓨마와
    난 골라야만 하는 걸까
    그 물음 앞에서 난
    꿀 먹은 듯 벙어리
    Tricky한 선택의 팔레트 중 몰라 내 색
    고민의 연속 어둠 속의 end

    나을지도 복불복이
    말처럼 마냥 not easy

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Maybe 내일도 현실도피
    상상 속의 도핑 아직
    선택하기 싫어 I don't care
    I just wanna skip it

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Pick your 답 A or B, balance game 앞 퓨마와

    <p class="lyrics-fight">Pick your answer A or B
    In front of the balance game, with a PUMA
    Do I have to choose
    In front of that question I
    Mute as if I ate honey
    In this tricky choice of palette, I don't know my color
    This continuous dilemma, end in the darkness
    I need you to tell me if you feel the same
    I need you to tell me

    My exp is still zero (zero)
    I don't like unfamiliar places never ever (ever)
    What should I choose, what's good for me?
    A matter with no answer
    A sense of freedom that lingers outside that door
    (Run away!)
    Ay, ay, the moment I face it
    (Throw it up!)
    All around me is my chaser
    Be careful, it'll spread in an instant
    Try choosing, believer or saver

    Jaded, in this endless game
    The headache I feel, now
    Whatever happens, I don't care
    I just wanna skip it

    Pick your answer A or B
    In front of the balance game, with a PUMA
    Do I have to choose
    In front of that question I
    Mute as if I ate honey
    In this tricky choice of palette, I don't know my color
    This continuous dilemma, end in the darkness
    This freeze tag that continues in my brain
    I just want an answer

    On this crossroad, I'm clumsy
    The probability is fifty : fifty
    My choice will then be reality
    Either one, I'm not sure of
    Close eyes and guess it, guess it
    Between A and B, my choices
    It may be better, this hit-and-miss
    Not easy as it sounds

    What can it be, there might be no answer
    If you ask, there's no answer
    I'm good at speaking though, decently all
    Then come and bet, if it's your life, can you?
    There's no right answer, why do you conclude that
    Into a dilemma, I splash and fall again
    I can't like low key like this
    Stop, my head is already overloaded

    Maybe if it was me, stay in
    Zoo, but can't guess at that time
    What was it, the PUMA's feelings
    I don't know, just skip it

    Pick your answer A or B
    In front of the balance game, with a PUMA
    Do I have to choose
    In front of that question I
    Mute as if I ate honey
    In this tricky choice of palette, I don't know my color

    Close eyes and guess it, guess it
    Between A and B, my choices
    It may be better, this hit-and-miss

    Maybe tomorrow I'll escape reality
    In my imagination, I'm still doping
    I don't want to choose, I don't care
    I just wanna skip it

    Pick your answer A or B
    In front of the balance game, with a PUMA
    Do I have to choose
    In front of that question I
    Mute as if I ate honey
    In this tricky choice of palette, I don’t know my color

    <h2>NO RULES</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-fight">It is a bright and exciting retro-punk-pop genre song that tells the story of a teenager who faces a world where rules have disappeared after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
        With a refreshing retro sound, danceable punk grooves, and colorful rap, it is a song that anyone can enjoy. The lyrics of 'New Rules', a song from their first studio album 'Dream Chapter: MAGIC', capture the confusion they feel while living in the present where 'no rules' has become the new rule, which is also intriguing. 
        Members Yeonjun, Hueningkai, Beomkyu, and Taehyun participated in the lyrics.</p>

    Come and feel my vibe, vibe
    Yeah, yeah, come on

    <strong>[Verse 1: Soobin, Taehyun, Huening Kai]</strong>
    왜 이런 걸까
    나도 잘 몰라
    어서 일어나
    You wake up (Come my way, come my way, come my way)
    다시 눈을 감아
    꿈을 이어나가, yeah
    펑크이고 싶은 나였는데

    왼발인지 오른발인지
    지금 A.M.인지 P.M.인지
    망가진 패턴 전부 헷갈려
    뭐가 맞는 건지 I don't get it
    Ooh, 내 세계는 panic (Panic, panic)
    Yeah, you know what I like?

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Huening Kai]</strong>

    현실은 bottom (Lightning)
    Hit me like lightning

    지쳐가, yeah (지쳐가)
    I don't wanna dance (Dance)
    Dance anymore (No more, no more)

    <strong>[Outro: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>

    <p class="modal-songs-description-fight">TOMORROW X TOGETHER's first fan song. They expressed their feelings for Moa, who has been in love for a long time, through an item called 'Exchange Diary' that shares their feelings with each other. 
        The five members showed their special fan love with lyrics written by themselves, thinking of Moa. 
        The TOMORROW X TOGETHER and Moa's unique password hidden in the lyrics are the points of interest. It is a danceable pop genre that combines catchy choruses with rich instrumental sounds to create a cheerful yet refreshing atmosphere</p>

    So that I don't go anywhere

    I am here for you
    Till the end, till the end, till you call my name
    Here for you
    I'll be there, I'll be there till the sweeter end
    Here for you
    That saying that 'let's be together tomorrow as well'
    Here for you
    Please promise that here

    Dubaddu wari wari
    Dubaddu wari wari
    He-e-ey whisper it
    The secret between you and I
    They say it's childish, what?
    It fits us
    One more time
    Dubaddu wari wari
    Make a spell

    Look back
    All the times you felt alone
    Stand by me all night
    We'll be together forever
    Kick back
    Our time when we cried and laughed together
    Tomorrow that will be laid out
    They'll all shine bright

    I am here for you
    Till the end, till the end, till you call my name
    Here for you
    I'll be there, I'll be there till the sweeter end
    Here for you
    That saying that 'let's be together tomorrow as well'
    Here for you
    Please promise that here
    (Shine shine)

    Until you're shining
    Shining shining by my side</p>

    <p class= 'modal-note-fight'>note: 'Forever MOA/영원히 모아' can also mean 'Forever gathering' so all together the alternate version of the sentence would be 'Forever gathering the dream-like time you and I spent together'</p>

    <p class= 'modal-note-fight'>side note: the theme of 'moa diary' (literal translation: exchange diary) is inspired by how txt used to write diary entries for moas during their pre-debut and early debut days.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-fight"><strong>[Intro]</strong>
    Oh-oh-oh-oh, hey-eh-eh-eh

    <strong>[Verse 1: Huening Kai, Yeonjun, Taehyun, Soobin]</strong>
    Empty
    시작돼 다시 끝없이 텅 빈 날
    Lonely
    차디찬 대기 속 미친 외로움만
    날 이끄는 나침반 저 유성우를 따라서
    정처 없이 달려가 답을 찾아 답을 찾아
    희미하게 빛나는 내 우주의 끝에서
    긴 방황은 마침내 끝을 만나 끝을 만나

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Oh my Sputnik
    운명이여 찾아냈네 (넌 또 다른 나)
    Call me destiny
    Because I know 너도 나와 같은 걸

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Huening Kai]</strong>
    단 하나의 온기
    얼어붙은 손이
    마주 잡은 순간 다 녹아내려 (내려)
    너는 나의 orbit
    You're my one and only
    밤하늘을 함께 fly with you

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Beomgyu]</strong>
    We're gonna glow, oh, oh, oh-oh (With you, we fly)
    Gotta go, oh, oh, oh-oh (Don't stop, we ride)
    We're gonna glow, oh, oh, oh-oh (With you, we fly)
    Gotta go, oh, oh, oh-oh (Don't stop, we ride)

    <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun, Beomgyu, Huening Kai, Soobin]</strong>
    너와 손잡으면 (잡으면)
    상처는 찬란한 흔적이 돼 (찬란한)
    수없이 우주를 돌아
    마침내 겹친 궤도야
    기적같이 만난 거야 (Oh yeah, yeah)

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Beomgyu, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>

    You're my one and only
    밤하늘을 함께 fly with you

    We're gonna glow, oh, oh, oh-oh (With you, we fly)
    Gotta go, oh, oh, oh-oh (Don't stop, we ride)

    <strong>[Bridge: Beomgyu, Taehyun]</strong>
    무너진 세상에서
    발견한 너라는 별
    I need you, my love
    녹슬지 않게 해줘
    영원을 믿게 해줘
    여정의 시작을 함께 해

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Yeonjun, Taehyun]</strong>
    외로움을 건너 (Yeah)
    창공을 날아서 (Oh, ooh-woah-woah)
    별빛 속에 영원을 새길 거야
    영원보다 멀리 (멀리)
    끝이 없는 journey (Journey, yeah)
    우리의 여행은 계속될 거야 (Ooh)

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-fight">Empty
    It starts again, the endless and empty day
    Lonely
    In this cold waiting, this crazy loneliness
    The compass that guides me
    Following that meteor shower
    I run without a destination
    To find an answer, to find an answer
    Faintly shining
    At the end of my universe
    The long wandering has finally
    Come to an end, come to an end

    Oh my Sputnik
    I've found my destiny (you're another me)
    Call me destiny
    Because I know you're like me

    A single warmth
    My frozen hands
    Once they're held together, it all melts away (away)
    You're my orbit
    You're my one and only
    In the night sky, fly with you

    We're gonna glow (with you, we fly)
    Gotta go (don't stop, we ride)
    We're gonna glow (with you, we fly)
    Gotta go (don't stop, we ride)

    When I hold hands with you (hold hands)
    My scars become glorious traces (glorious)
    Orbiting the universe countless times
    Our orbits have finally overlapped
    We've met like a miracle

    Oh my Sputnik
    I've found my destiny (you're another me)
    Call me destiny
    Because I know you're like me

    A single warmth
    My frozen hands
    Once they're held together, it all melts away (away)
    You're my orbit
    You're my one and only
    In the night sky, fly with you

    We're gonna glow (with you, we fly)
    Gotta go (don't stop, we ride)
    We're gonna glow (with you, we fly)
    Gotta go (don't stop, we ride)

    In this demolished world
    A star called you that I found
    I need you, my love
    Please don't make me rust
    Please make me believe in eternity
    Let's start this journey together

    Across this loneliness
    Fly in the blue sky
    We will engrave “eternity” among the starlight
    Further than eternity
    This endless journey
    Our journey will continue

    We're gonna glow (with you, we fly)
    Gotta go (don't stop, we ride)
    We're gonna glow (with you, we fly)
    Gotta go (don't stop, we ride)</p>

    <h2>FROST</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-fight">It is a trap-based hyperpop genre, and the magnificent electric guitar sound catches the ear from the beginning. The intense and unique sound created by the rough-textured percussion and heavy bass is complemented by TOMORROW X TOGETHER's experimental vocal sound. 
        After realizing his fate for the first time, he unraveled the confused boy's mind by comparing it to 'frost'. 
        The song is linked to the original story 'The Star Seekers', which depicts the growth of five special boys, and was written by artist Ashnikko, who is active mainly in London, and member Yeonjun participated in the lyrics.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-fight"><strong>[Intro: Huening Kai]</strong>
    I'm so shocked
    Ha-ha-ha

    <strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
    봄이 와도 없어 어디에도 온기
    창밖엔 날카로운 바늘이 돋아 막
    하얀 숨결 like icy
    흔적 없이 gone 일렁이던 별빛
    Stuck in my heart 커진 구멍
    베일에 싸인 저 작은 섬
    잠식된 영혼 안
    I'm hollowed out 또 다시

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    날 부르는 voices, I'm in chaos now
    이름에 이끌려 온 혼란 속 나
    Really lost my mind
    Really, really, really, really lost it
    희미한 voices, 모르겠어 why?
    내 운명은 what? 뭘까 정답, 정말
    Really lost my mind
    Really, really, really, lost it (Ha-ha)

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
    얼어붙은 내 입술
    혀끝에 맴돌아
    불러봐도 그 이름
    차가운 입김만
    낯선 이름에 깃든
    운명 or 무언가
    알 수 없어 의미들
    하얗게 맺혀가

    <strong>[Verse 2: Soobin, Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    결빙 호수를 건너 길 따라
    다다른 끝에 멈춘 sign
    날 맞이해 오직 찬바람
    빛을 잃은 얼음 속 슬픈 flower
    운명의 난파
    멈춘듯한 time
    그 속에 I'm dying
    Yeah, ah

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    날 부르는 voices, I'm in chaos now
    이름에 이끌려 온 혼란 속 나
    Really lost my mind
    Really, really, really, really lost it
    희미한 voices, 모르겠어 why?
    내 운명은 what? 뭘까 정답, 정말
    Really lost my mind
    Really, really, really, lost it (Ha-ha)

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Soobin]</strong>
    얼어붙은 내 입술
    혀끝에 맴돌아
    불러봐도 그 이름
    차가운 입김만
    낯선 이름에 깃든
    운명 or 무언가
    알 수 없어 의미들
    하얗게 맺혀가

    <strong>[Bridge: Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    꿈의 섬엔 혼란만이 exist
    도망쳐도 빠져 불안 깊이
    이름 앞에 얼어붙은 의미
    Am I ready for this?

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Soobin]</strong>
    얼어붙은 내 입술
    혀끝에 맴돌아
    불러봐도 그 이름
    차가운 입김만
    낯선 이름에 깃든
    운명 or 무언가
    알 수 없어 의미들

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-fight">I'm so shocked

    Even when spring came, warmth is nowhere
    Outside the window, there's sharp needles growing
    White breath like icy
    Without a trace, gone, the swaying starlight
    Stuck in my heart, the hole that got bigger
    The small island covered in a veil
    In the intruded spirit
    I'm hollowed out, once again

    The voices that are calling me
    I'm in chaos now
    Carried away by a name, I inside chaos
    Really lost my mind
    Really really really really lost it
    The faint voices
    I don't know why
    My destiny, what? What's the answer, really
    Really lost my mind
    Really really really lost it

    My lips have frozen shut
    It lingers at the tip of my tongue
    Even if I call that name
    Only a cold breath
    Dwelling inside the unfamiliar name
    Destiny or something
    I can't understand its meaning
    It becomes white

    Across the frozen lake, following the path
    Arrive at the end, the sign stops
    It greets me, only a cold air
    Inside the ice that lost light, a sad flower
    The wrecked destiny
    The time that seems to have stopped
    Inside it, I'm dying

    The voices that are calling me
    I'm in chaos now
    Carried away by a name, I inside chaos
    Really lost my mind
    Really really really really lost it
    The faint voices
    I don't know why
    My destiny, what? What's the answer, really
    Really lost my mind
    Really really really lost it

    My lips have frozen shut
    It lingers at the tip of my tongue
    Even if I call that name
    Only a cold breath
    Dwelling inside the unfamiliar name
    Destiny or something
    I can't understand its meaning
    It becomes white

    In the island of dreams, only chaos exist
    Even if I run away, I fall deep into anxiety
    In front of the name, the frozen meaning
    (Am I ready for this?)

    My lips have frozen shut
    It lingers at the tip of my tongue
    Even if I call that name
    Only a cold breath
    Dwelling inside the unfamiliar name
    Destiny or something
    I can't understand its meaning
    It becomes white</p>

        The instrumental sources that embody the mournful and hopeless feeling without filtering and the rough and decadent guitar sound give it a different charm from the original song.</p>

        Please use me like a drug
        (I know I love you)

        The spirit with a hole, skin started growing
        The cold atmosphere is melting
        In this zero world
        I found a warmth called you
        You take all of me away
        Girl I need you

        I'm filled with troubles, love sick
        There was no road
        It was okay if I died
        I'm a loser in this game
        The on1y law in this world
        Save me
        Hold my hand
        Please use me like a drug
        (I know I love you)

        Say you love me
        Say you love me
        Until the end of the world
        All or nothing
        I want all of you
        (I know I love you)
        Say you love me
        Say you love me
        Until the end of the world
        All or nothing
        I want all of you
        (I know I love you)</p>
