        <p>The Name Chapter: FREEFALL is a story of the youth who had been delaying their adulthood and escaping from the world but finally decided to face reality. 
            The process of freefalling into reality is tormenting, and reality bites, but they make a firm determination to go on, facing up to everything around them. <br>
            TOMORROW X TOGETHER's resplendent coming-of-age story is anticipated to offer comfort and empathy to all of those moving toward their dreams</p>

    <h2>GROWING PAIN</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freefall">It is a metal-based hard rock genre song. The dynamic drums and rough-textured distortion guitar are attractive, and the explosive melody and the tone of TOMORROW X TOGETHER maximize the dreamy atmosphere and immersion. 
        The first thing he encountered on the journey to reality from the beautiful but irresponsible paradise was the pain that came at the moment of the downhill. The boy decides to accept even this pain as growing pains. 
        Yeonjun, Taehyun, and Hueningkai participated in the lyrics.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-freefall"><strong>[Verse 1: Huening Kai, Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Been free falling
    허공 속으로
    낙원의 끝 절벽 아래
    Don't know how to fly but I'm gonna try to let go
    온몸을 다 할퀴는
    날카로운 air
    중력은 날 끌어당기네
    Don't know how to fly but I'm gonna try to let go

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Beomgyu, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    어린 시절의 꿈
    끝없는 낙하 성장의 증거
    깨면 끝이 났던 그 꿈과는 달라
    온몸이 아파, there's no way to stop
    I throw myself, throw myself, throw myself
    Free falling, falling, falling, say

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
    (Ooh) 떨어져 끝없이
    (Ooh) 기꺼이 go low
    고통 속으로
    던져버려, body, yeah
    (Ooh) 부딪혀 겁 없이
    (Ooh) 곤두박질쳐
    현실 속으로
    던져버려, body, yeah

    <strong>[Verse 2: Huening Kai, Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    눈을 떠
    저기 땅을 보렴
    피하지 마 절대
    You just gotta face it
    피가 흐르고
    뼈가 부러진대도
    Gotta make my way through this
    I'm falling

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    (Ooh) 떨어져 끝없이
    (Ooh) 기꺼이 go low
    고통 속으로
    던져버려, body, yeah
    (Ooh) 부딪혀 겁 없이
    (Ooh) 곤두박질쳐
    현실 속으로
    던져버려, body, yeah

    <strong>[Bridge: Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Go
    후횐 없어 (후횐 없어)
    거짓 없는 꿈에 나를 던져
    I'm falling

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
    (Ooh) 떨어져 끝없이
    (Ooh) 기꺼이 go low
    고통 속으로
    던져버려, body, yeah
    (Ooh) 부딪혀 겁 없이
    (Ooh) 곤두박질쳐

    <h3>English Translation</h3>
    <p class="lyrics-freefall">Been free falling
    Into the sky
    The end of paradise is under the cliff
    (Don't know how to fly but I'm gonna try to let go)

    The sharp air
    That scratches my whole body
    Gravity attracts me
    (Don't know how to fly, but I'm gonna try to let go)

    The dream I had when I was a child
    The endless freefall 
    The proof of growth
    When I'm awaken, it's different from that dream that ended

    My whole body hurts
    There's no way to stop
    I throw myself
    Throw myself
    Throw myself
    Free falling, falling, falling
    Say

    Falling endlessly
    Willingly go low
    Into the pain
    Throw your body yeah
    Crash without any fear
    Fall head first into reality
    Throw your body yeah

    Open your eyes
    Look at the ground right there
    Don't avoid it at any cost (You just gotta face it)
    Even if you bleed
    Even if your bones break
    Gotta make my way through this

    I'm falling
    Falling endlessly
    Willingly go low
    Into the pain
    Throw your body yeah
    Crash without any fear
    Fall head first into reality
    Throw your body yeah

    I don't have any regrets
    Throw me into the dream with no lies
    I'm falling
    Falling endlessly
    Willingly go low
    Into the pain
    Throw your body yeah
    Crash without any fear
    Fall head first into reality
    Throw your body yeah</p>

    <h2>CHASING THAT FEELING</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freefall">It is a new wave genre with a 1980s sensibility, and its speedy melody, heavy beat, and synthesizer sound make good use of TOMORROW X TOGETHER's unique style. 
    It is a song that leaves behind the sweet but ungrowth past and announces a new beginning in reality. Unlike the romantic and hopeful hymns of youth, 
    TOMORROW X TOGETHER openly reveals and confronts the pain, anxiety, and even the emptiness of reality, raising the consensus of young people in this era.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-freefall"><strong>[Verse 1: Huening Kai, Taehyun, Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    미로 속을 걸어, all day, 위로 따윈 기대 못 해
    A pity, 내 발길이 더 길이 없어 휘청이네
    네버랜드 저 너머 사랑했던 꿈은 어려워
    Late night, 동경했던 꿈 앞에서 결국 고갤 숙여, no
    I know, you know, 꿈은 like magic
    Twinkle, twinkle, disappear
    철 좀 들어 뭣 같은 얘기
    이대로 도망갈까?

    <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
    발끝만 보던 그 밤
    밝게 빛나던 star
    쏟아진 light
    이제야 찾았어 난
    멀리 기다려 준 star
    난 다시 꿈을 꿔
    되찾은 name, 꿈을 좇는 chase

    New life, day and night
    새로 태어난 아이처럼 난 아이처럼 난
    널 따라가
    날 비추는 꿈
    꿈꾸지 않는 어른과 꿈뿐인 소년
    그 흔한 두 갈래 길 사이 난 gray
    어두워진대도 더 별빛은 shining
    빛을 따라 한 뼘 더 자라나

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>
    길고 긴 방황의 끝
    오랜 미래의 꿈
    내 이름을
    이제야 찾았어 난
    멀리 기다려 준 star
    아마 난 어쩔 수 없는 dreamer
    Yeah, I found a name
    I'm a dreamer, dreamer, dreamer with memories of stars

    <p class="lyrics-freefall">I've been walking inside this
    maze all day
    Can't expect any consolation 
    A pity, my footsteps
    Are faltering at a dead end

    Neverland and beyond 
    The dream that I loved there is complicated
    Late night, in front of the dream that 
    l once longed for, 
    I put my head down, no

    I know you know
    Dreams are like magic
    Twinkle, twinkle
    Disappear

    "Grow up, won't you?"
    These pathetic words
    Should I run away like this?
    That night where I only see the tips of my toes
    The star that shone bright
    The pouring light

    I've finally found it
    The star that awaits me afar
    I dream again
    The name I found again
    The chase of seeking the dream 
    I'm a dreamer, dreamer
    Dreamer with memories of stars
    Stars
    Stars

    Dreamer, dreamer, dreamer with
    Let me break it down for you
    New life
    Day and night
    Like a newborn baby, I 
    Like a baby, I
    Follow you

    The dream that lights me up
    A grown up that doesn't dream at all 
    and a boy that only dreams 
    Between these two common roads, I'm gray

    Even if it gets dark, the stars are shining
    Following the light, I grow a little
    more

    The end of my long wandering
    The dreams of the future ahead, 
    I finally found my name 
    The star that awaits me afar 
    Maybe I'm just a hopeless dreamer

    Yeah, I found a name 
    I'm a dreamer, dreamer, dreamer with memories of stars
    Stars
    Stars
    Dreamer, dreamer, dreamer with 
    Let me break it down for you</p>

    <h2>DEEP DOWN (머리에 솟아난 뿔은 나의 왕관이었다)</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freefall">The dreamy synthesizer sound and exciting drum rhythm create a sophisticated feel. 
        It is a pop song with elements of Jersey club rhythm and EDM, and Yeonjun participated in writing the lyrics. 
        As the lyrics say, "Difference was me" and "A special one and only given to me," the point is a mature perspective that realizes and 
        deeply accepts that the 'horn' (difference) that was only thought of as shameful can be one's own 'crown' (individuality and identity) and positive hope.</p>

    <p class="lyrics-freefall"><strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Taehyun]</strong>
    어느 날 훅 솟아난 뿔
    수치스러운 기분
    머릿속이 하얘 이불 속에 hiding
    오직 나 홀로 different

    <strong>[Refrain: Beomgyu, Huening Kai]</strong>
    끝없이 도망쳐 봐도
    결국 마주치는 내 자신과 뿔
    칠흑 같은 어둠 속
    널 부러뜨리기 직전 난 깨달아
    네가 없는 난 없어

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
    Telling me, 답이 뭔지?
    Telling me, 알게 됐지?
    다름이 곧 나였지?
    So deep down, I need you more
    Now I see what I can see
    It's a crown, 날 빛내지
    다름이 곧 what I need
    So deep down, I need you more

    You're my silver lining

    <strong>[Refrain: Beomgyu, Yeonjun]</strong>
    도망치고 외면해 봤지만
    운명이란 건 참 짓궂어
    환히 날 이끌던 빛은

    선명히 알게 됐어

    <h4>DEEP DOWN (The Horns That Grew On My Head Where Actually My Crown)</h4>
    <p class="lyrics-freefall">One day, suddenly
    Horns grew on my head 
    A shameful feeling 
    My mind went blank

    Hiding inside my blanket
    I'm the only one that's different
    Even if I try running away endlessly
    At the end, I'm faced with myself and my horns
    Inside this pitch-black darkness
    Right before I break you off, I realize

    That without you, there's no me 
    Telling me, what's the answer?
    Telling me, have you found it?
    Was the difference me?
    So deep down I need you more

    Now I see what I can see
    It's a crown, that makes me shine 
    The difference, what I need
    So deep down I need you more
    More more more more
    More more more more
    More more more more
    Deep down I need you more

    More more more more

    More more more more
    More more more more
    More more more more
    Deep down I need you more

    More more more more
    (Telling me)
    More more more more
    (Telling me)
    More more more more
    (Telling me)
    Deep down I need you more

    After the long wandering
    I've finally found out the truth
    The answer was so close by

    A big crown on me
    No longer hideous horns
    You're my silver lining
    Tried to run away and ignore it
    But this thing called 'destiny' is too mischievous
    The radiant light that's leading me
    Was you who was always making me shine

    I know clearly now
    Telling me, my difference
    Telling me, I'm the one who made it
    Telling me, one and only 
    So deep down, I need you more 
    It's not a flaw or something shameful
    Something that only I was given
    Special, one and only

    So deep down, I need you more 
    More more more more 
    More more more more 
    More more more more

    Deep down I need you more
    More more more more
    (Telling me)
    More more more more
    (Telling me)
    More more more more

    <h2>HAPPILY EVER AFTER</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freefall">This is a Judge club genre song with a bright and optimistic atmosphere, which sings about the heart of a boy who decides 
        to write his own story instead of accepting that there is no fairytale happy ending in reality. The addictive nature created by the synthesizer, fast-paced rhythm 
        patterns, and repetitive vocal hooks is attractive. Taehyun and Yeonjun participated in the lyrics.</p>

    <strong>[Verse 1: Taehyun, Soobin, Huening Kai, Beomgyu]</strong>
    나는 내가 꼭 멋진 동화 속
    주인공인 줄로만 알았어
    짧은 역경 뒤 결국엔 승리
    그 후로 오래 행복했었대
    그렇게 생각했던 내가 stupid
    알고 보니 정답은 없는 현실
    수없는 선택지 나의 몫이지?
    What's happening to me? Where's happy ending?

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>
    Wow
    동화책을 덮어도
    삶이 계속 이어져, realized
    영원히 no happily ever after

    La-la, la-la, la, la

    <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun, Huening Kai]</strong>
    매일 새로운 태양에게 good morning
    기분 좋은 문장이 떠오르지
    텅 빈 여백 위에 생긴 직접 써 내려갈 얘기
    내가 만들어 가 다

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
    Wow
    알 수 없는 마지막
    그래서 더 아름다운 my life (다운, 다운, my life)
    껴안아 실패마저, I keep going, yeah

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Yeonjun, Taehyun, Soobin]</strong>
    Oh, my God, 끝을 알 수 없네 (알 수 없네)

    La-la-la-la-la-la, love all my days (Love all my days)
    All my life, 끝나지 않는 tales
    Three-six-five, every day (Every day, oh)
    내가 써 내려가는 열린 ending
    La-la-la-la-la-la, love all my days

    우린 잔잔한 강물에
    모난 돌 던지기를 사랑해
    아픈 시간일 걸 알아
    그럼에도 다른 돌을 쥐네
    너는 어떤 마음으로
    너를 던지는 건지 궁금해
    숱한 감정들이
    네 호수를 채워 가는데

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    상처를 집어삼킨 물은 언젠가 잠잠해져 (잠잠해져)
    넓은 품을 갖게 될 테니
    손끝에 뭉근히 맺힌 미련을 던져
    늘 그랬듯 늘 그래 왔듯이

    내일의 내가 안을 수 있게 (Ah-ah-ah)
    반짝이는 물결 위 닿을 때 (Ah-ah-ah)
    떨려오는 두 손 잡아 줄게

    Feeling blue, 시리게 파란 날들
    따뜻이 날 안아준 널 기억해
    It's just like magic 너뿐이야
    내 뿔도 crown으로 바꾼 너
    Now all my days and nights
    봄바람이 번져 when you call out my name

    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
    When we're high, when we're low
    넌 늘 곁에
    All my youth, 가득 차
    너의 온기
    따스한 너의 숨결에
    서늘했던 내 세계에
    마침내 피어난 봄
    나의 blue spring

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Soobin, Beomgyu]</strong>
    (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
    Flowers, flowers
    (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
    Flowers, flowers
    (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
    Flowers, flowers
    마침내 피어난 봄
    나의 blue spring

    <strong>[Verse 2: Soobin, Taehyun, Beomgyu, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Blue 속 피어난 flowers (Flowers)
    따스한 우리들의 hours (Hours)
    함께하자는 우리 promise (Promise)
    오랜 겨울 끝 찾아온
    봄이 됐어 넌
    I'll be with you, every moment
    You said, "우린 destiny
    서로 없인 can't imagine it"

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Huening Kai]</strong>
    When we're high, when we're low
    넌 늘 곁에
    All my youth, 가득 차
    너의 온기
    따스한 너의 숨결에
    서늘했던 내 세계에
    마침내 피어난 봄
    나의 blue spring

    <p class="lyrics-freefall">When we're high, when we're low, you're always by my side
    You've filled up all my youth with your warmth
    The warm waves of your breath made my cold

    You're my blue spring

    Nobody knows about the abundant 
    anxiousness that winter, my nervous heartbeat

    breeze blows when you're calling my name

    at the end of a long winter
    I'll be with you every moment
    You said 'we' are destiny
    So l can't imagine it without you

    <p class="modal-note-freefall">Taehyun explained that he came up with the concept of 'Blue Spring' where
    Blue = 청/cheong and Spring = 춘/chun. The two words together make
    the word 烈（青春）/cheongchun which means 'youth" signifying that we are each other's youth</p>

    <h2>DO IT LIKE THAT</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freefall">A summer song with a danceable track with a funky bass line. The lyrics and melody express the ecstatic moment of falling in love are impressive, and the synthesizers, claps, and upbeat percussion sounds are combined to create excitement. 
        While the lyrics filled with happiness enliven the entire song, the catchy chorus is so catchy that anyone can sing along from the first note is attractive.</p>

    <h2>CHASING THAT FEELING (English Version)</h2>
    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-freefall"><strong>[Verse 1: Beomgyu, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Lost on a moonlit night
    Summer, one-nine
    Thought it would last forever
    Never felt more alive
    Life was so simple then
    A perpetual high
    Those days that I knew may be gone
    But I won't let them die

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun, Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Time's a thief that keeps on stealing
    I just keep on chasing that feeling
    Won't give up, won't stop believing
    I just keep on chasing, chasing that
    Feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    It's all I know, it's all I know

    <strong>[Verse 2: Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
    Didn't know what I had, did I?
    Left it all in the past
    Hoping for twice in a lifetime
    Is that too much to ask?
    Lightning across the sky
    Went by in a flash
    I'll keep running faster
    Chasing one more chance

    <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    Time's a thief that keeps on stealing
    I just keep on chasing that feeling
    Won't give up, won't stop believing
    I just keep on chasing, chasing that
    Feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    It's all I know, it's all I know

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Huening Kai]</strong>
    I'm chasing
    Chasing
    I'm chasing

    <strong>[Bridge: Yeonjun]</strong>
    In my kaleidoscopе
    Are pressed butterflies
    Reminding me I've only one life

    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Beomgyu, Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
    Time's a thief that keeps on stealing
    I just keep on chasing that feeling
    Won't give up, won't stop believing
    I just keep on chasing, chasing that
    Feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    Chasing that feeling
    It's all I know, it's all I know

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
    I keep chasing, chasing
    I'm chasing
    Chasing
    Chasing that feeling</p>

    <h2>BACK FOR MORE (ft. ANITTA)</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freefall">Back for More (with Anitta) is a song that says that magical miracle moments exist in everyday life, and for me, reunion with 'you' will be such a moment. 
        Unlike the bright and cheerful atmosphere that Tomorrow By Together used to have a bright and cheerful atmosphere in disco songs, the sexy charm stands out in this song</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-freefall"><strong>[Intro: Beomgyu]</strong>
    I can see you comin' back for more
    Comin' back for more, ayy
    If you walk out that door

    <strong>[Verse 1: Taehyun, Huening Kai]</strong>
    When I'm with you, it all feels different
    When I'm with you, it all makes sense
    And I know you don't feel no different
    Woah-ooh
    There's a magic to how we livin'
    There's a magic to what this is
    It's like a dream and we both day-trippin'
    Woah-ooh

    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>
    All I know is if you walk away
    There'll be something
    There'll be things you can't replace
    All I know is if you walk away
    There'll be something
    Baby, that's okay, 'cause

    <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
    I can see you comin' back for more
    Comin' back for more (Yeah)
    If you walk out that door
    I can see you comin' back for more (Can you?)
    Comin' back for more (Yeah)
    If you walk out that door

    <strong>[Verse 2: Anitta, Yeonjun]</strong>
    I don't wanna feel nobody
    If it isn't you, baby
    Contigo me pongo naughty
    Been thinking about you lately
    Ita, ita
    Loco como mueve el culo, Anitta
    De todas yo soy la favorita
    Tú estás pa' mí y yo pa' ti todita
    Pa-pa-pam-pam, pam-pam-pam-pam
    I know what you like, sing it like
    Pa-pa-pam-pam, pam-pam-pam-pam
    Esto va a empezar (Oh)

    There'll be something (Something)
    Baby, that's okay, 'cause

    <strong>[Chorus: Beomgyu, Beomgyu & Anitta, Soobin, Anitta, *Taehyun*]</strong>
    I can see you comin' back for more
    Comin' back for more (Hey)
    If you walk out that door
    I can see you comin' back for more (I can see you, *Ooh-ooh, ow*)
    Comin' back for more (*Got me back for more, ah*)
    If you walk out that door (*Come on*; Door, oh)

    <strong>[Post-Chorus: Taehyun, Taehyun & Anitta, Huening Kai, Anitta]</strong>
    When I'm with you, it all feels different
    When I'm with you, when I'm with you (No)
