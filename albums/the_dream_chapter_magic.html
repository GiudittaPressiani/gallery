                TOMORROW X TOGETHER unfolds their story of growth and encounters in this new journey through the album concept The Dream Chapter. While The Dream Chapter: STAR expressed the “happiness and excitement of meeting that special someone”, 
                The Dream Chapter: MAGIC tells the story of “magical adventures” that boys encounter together with their friends who are different, yet alike. Through this adventure, the boys share their transformation, confusion and exploding emotions that arise during their transition to adolescence.
                The album includes 8 tracks: “New Rules” that talks about the desire of wanting to create their own rules of the world, the lead single “9 and Three Quarters (Run Away)”, “Roller Coaster” which depicts the fearful but also an exciting moment like a rollercoaster ride, and “Angel Or Devil” singing about the two inner voices fighting endlessly.

                    <strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
                    I think I'm feeling all right
                    아니면 아니었나 hey
                    반복의 수학시간
                    선들에 갇힌 내 삶

                    <strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
                    왼발, 오른발이면
                    오른발, 왼발이 편해
                    왜 이런지는 나도 몰라
                    세상 모든 게 선악과 (Yum, yum)

                    <strong>[Post-Verse]</strong>
                    (왜) 잠긴 옥상엔
                    (왜)더 괜히 가고 싶어
                    (왜, 왜) 정해진 문자 말투
                    난 지겨워 지겨워
                    (왜) 페북, 인스타에선
                    (왜) 쌤이 왜 이렇게 많아
                    (왜, 왜) 수업이 왜 이렇게 많아
                    다 비켜 비켜줘

                    <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
                    나 벌받을게 뻔해도
                    더 짜릿한걸 원해 갖다 줘
                    넘지 말라면 I want it
                    하지 말라면 I do it
                    Stupid, but 난
           
                    <strong>[Chorus]</strong>

                    Let me go, let me go, let me go, go, go

                    Where we go? Don't know

                    나의 투명한 족쇄를 깨고

                    Trouble, trouble, let me go
                    I'm trouble maker, let me go

                    그건 누구의 상식 (상식)
                    검증받고 왔니?
                    뭐 어디 석사님 박사님께?

                    Do it what I like it (Like it)

                    My life caught between strings

                    If it's left foot, right foot,
                    Right foot, left foot is more comfortable
                    I don't know why I'm like this
                    Everything in the world is good or evil (yum yum)

                    If the attic is locked, I want to go even more
                    I'm tired, tired of the fixed words and speech
                    (Why) In Facebook and Instagram
                    (Why) are there so many teachers
                    (Why, why) are there so many classes
                    Get out, out of my way

                    Even though it's obvious I'll get punished

                    I don't know why I'm like this
                    Everything in the world is good or evil
                </p>

                <h2>9 AND THREE QUARTERS (RUN AWAY) [9와 4분의 3 승강장에서 너를 기다려 (Run Away)]</h2>
                <p class="modal-songs-description-magic">The title track, "Waiting for You at the 9 and 3/4 Platform (Run Away)," is a synth pop genre song with the addition of New Wave, which was popular in the 1980s. 
                    We expressed our special space, which was only allowed to me and my friends, with the unique word '9 and 3/4 platform'. 
                    The lyrics, which say that if you hold hands together when you are sad and crying, you can cross over to a special space, reminding you of a way out that exists somewhere in a difficult reality that everyone has imagined at least once. </p>

                <p class="lyrics-magic">
                    <strong>[Verse 1: Beomgyu, Taehyun, Huening Kai]</strong>
                    나만 빼고 다 행복한 것만 같아
                    우는 것보다 웃을 때가 더 아파
                    맨날 참아보려 해도 버텨보려 해도
                    그게 잘 안돼, 지금 내겐 네 손이 필요해

                    <strong>[Post-Verse: Yeonjun, Taehyun]</strong>
                    그럴 땐, 눈물이 날 땐
                    내 손을 꽉 잡아, 도망갈까?
                    숨겨진 9와 4분의 3엔
                    함께여야 갈 수 있어

                    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Beomgyu, Soobin]</strong>
                    비비디 바비디 열차가 출발하네
                    비비디 바비디 우리의 매직 아일랜드
                    이 터널을 지나면
                    눈을 뜨고 나면
                    꿈속은 현실이 돼

                    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
                    내 영원이 돼줘 내 이름 불러줘
                    Run away, run away, run away with me
                    세상의 끝에서 forever together
                    Run away babe 내게 대답 해줘

                    <strong>[Refrain: Beomgyu, Soobin, Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
                    말해줘 yes '아니'는 no
                    Don't wanna stay 자 이제 go
                    너와 나 함께라면 하늘 위를 달려
                    말해줘 yes '아니'는 no
                    Don't wanna stay 자 이제 go
                    지금 날 데려가 줘 우리라는 마법에

                    <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun, Huening Kai]</strong>
                    I don't, I don't wanna wake up
                    내 지팡이는 알람 브레이커
                    우주 속을 우린 헤엄
                    두 개의 꼬리별이 되어 bungee
                    It's okay, don't be afraid
                    우리가 함께해

                    <strong>[Post-Verse: Beomgyu, Taehyun]</strong>
                    이 밤이 끝나려 할 땐
                    시계를 되감아 지금 rewind (지금 rewind)
                    금지된 장난과 이 magic hour (Oh, yeah)
                    푸른 빛 불꽃이 피어

                    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>
                    하늘빛 마법진, 교실을 색칠할래 (Ohh)
                    소환의 주문이 너와 날 이어 주게 (Ohh)
                    이 터널을 지나면 눈을 뜨고 나면
                    꿈속은 현실이 돼 (Ohh)


                    <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
                    내 영원이 돼줘 내 이름 불러줘
                    Run away, run away, run away with me

                    <strong>[Bridge: Yeonjun, Taehyun, Soobin & Beomgyu]</strong>
                    캄캄한 밤 그 계단 밑에서
                    널 본 순간 마법은 시작됐어
                    네 눈물로 주문을 만들자
                    다신 울지 않게 (Oh, woah)

                    It feels like everyone is happy except me
                    It hurts more when I laugh than when I cry
                    Even though I try to suppress, endure every day
                    It doesn't work, I need your hand right now

                    In those time, when tears come down
                    Hold my hand, should we run away?
                    The hidden 9 and three quarters
                    Can only be reached together

                    Bibbidi bobbidi the train is starting
                    Bibbidi bobbidi our magic island
                    When we pass through this tunnel
                    And we open our eyes
                    Our dreams become reality

                    Be my forever, call my name
                    Run away, run away, run away with me

                    Tell me yes, 'no' is no
                    Don't wanna stay, now go

                    I don't, I don't wanna wake up
                    My wand is an alarm breaker
                    We are swimming through space
                    Becoming two Tailstars, and bungee
                    It's okay, don't be afraid
                    Let's be together

                    The game that is forbidden, this magic hour
                    The blue light, the fireworks are blooming

                    The light blue magic circle, I want to color the classroom
                    So that the summoning spell can connect you and me
                    If we pass through this tunnel and open our eyes
                    Our dreams become reality

                    In a dark night, under the stairs
                    Magic started the moment I saw you
                    Let's make your tears into a spell
                    So that you'll never cry

                    Be my forever, call my name
                    Run away, run away, run away with me
                    At the end of the world, forever together

                <h2>ROLLER COASTER</h2>
                <p class="modal-songs-description-magic">'Roller Coaster' is a song in the UK Garage genre based on a retro old-school sound. 
                    It's trendy yet has the vibe of the New Jack Swing of the 1990s. The catchy synth sound that unfolds throughout the song adds to its uniqueness. 
                    On top of that, TOMORROW X TOGETHER's unique sweet vocals meet to convey a new charm. The scary but pleasant moment was expressed as an emotion like riding a roller coaster. 
                    The intuitive lyrics, which make you feel like you are on a roller coaster, seem to see the hearts of boys. 
                    The development of the song, which begins with a rhythmic drum fill-in and continues with a colorful pattern of rhythm, depicts the emotions of these boys in detail and purity. </p>

                    <strong>[Intro: Soobin]</strong>
                    So itchy, so itchy
                    So itchy, so itchy

                    <strong>[Verse 1: Taehyun, Beomgyu]</strong>
                    멍해졌어 넋이 나갔어
                    눈도 못 뜨겠어
                    처음이면서 무서웠으면서
                    거짓말을 했어

                    <strong>[Verse 2: Huening Kai, Yeonjun, (Beomgyu)]</strong>
                    드르르륵 소리가 머리 안에 맴도네 (So itchy, so itchy)
                    벌써 많이 높지만 계속 올라가기만 해 (So itchy, so itchy)

                    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
                    몸이 젖혀져 하늘이 보여
                    저 구름 건너 절벽이 보여
                    주먹을 꽉 입이 마르고
                    추락하는 나

                    <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
                    내 손을 잡아
                    눈을 떠봐봐
                    심장이 몸 속을 떠다녀
                    간지러워 (So itchy)
                    내 손을 잡아
                    We gon' fall right now
                    머릿속 새들이 노래해
                    간지러워 (워 워 워)

                    <strong>[Verse 3: Beomgyu, Huening Kai]</strong>
                    간지러워 등허리를 타서
                    머리 끝까지
                    이제야 들려 네 웃음소리
                    Same we are

                    <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
                    차가운 바람 하늘색 감각
                    황홀한 추락 영원의 순간
                    I'm not afraid 손 놓침 안돼
                    It's time till we fall

                    <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Beomgyu]</strong>
                    내 손을 잡아
                    눈을 떠봐봐

                    간지러워 (So itchy)
                    내 손을 잡아 (Oh, oh, oh)
                    We gon' fall right now (Oh, oh, oh)
                    머릿속 새들이 노래해

                    <strong>[Bridge: Taehyun, Yeonjun, Huening Kai]</strong>
                    망설이지 말아 두려워도 말아
                    절벽 넘어 허공으로 너는 나를 밀어
                    왠지 그게 전혀 안 싫어
                    웃음이 터져 자꾸

                    <strong>[Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
                    내 손을 잡아 (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

                    머릿속 새들이 노래해
                    간지러워 (워 워 워)

                    <strong>[Outro: All, Soobin]</strong>

                    So itchy, so itchy

                    I'm blank, I've lost my mind
                    I can't open my eyes
                    Even though it was the first time, I was scared but
                    I lied

                    The drrrr sound is echoing in my head
                    It's already so high but it keeps on going higher

                    My body is leaned back and I can only see the sky
                    I see a cliff through those clouds
                    I clench my fists, my lips are dry
                    I am falling

                    Hold my hand and open your eyes
                    My heart is floating around my body, it itches
                    Hold my hand, we gon fall right now
                    The birds inside my head are singing it itches

                    It itches, through my back and spine
                    To the top of my head
                    I can finally hear your laugh
                    Same we are

                    The cold wind and the light blue sensation
                    The ecstatic fall, the eternal moment
                    I'm not afraid, don't let go of my hand
                    It's time to we fall

                    Hold my hand and open your eyes
                    My heart is floating around my body, it itches
                    Hold my hand, we gon fall right now
                    The birds inside my head are singing it itches

                    Don't hesitate, don't be afraid either
                    You push me to the empty air past the cliff
                    For some reason I don't hate it at all
                    I keep on bursting into laughter

                    Hold my hand and open your eyes
                    My heart is floating around my body, it itches
                    Hold my hand, we gon fall right now
                    The birds inside my head are singing it itches

                <p class="lyrics-magic">
                    <strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
                    짜릿한 정전기 you're popping star
                    머리가 띵하게 기분 좋은 my love

                    <strong>[Post-Verse]</strong>
                    아 이건 어쩌면 별가루 가득
                    물면 느껴지는 불꽃놀이일까?
                    입 안을 채운 콕콕 따끔한 이 느낌은 또
                    달콤한 게 날 녹여 버리잖아

                    <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
                    찌릿찌릿 전류처럼 묘해
                    더 더 더 강한 popping이 필요해
                    이걸론 부족해 더 센 걸 원해
                    레몬 라임 오렌지를 가득 chew, yeh

                    <strong>[Chorus]</strong>
                    더 더 더 강한 popping이 필요해
                    레몬 라임 오렌지를 가득 chew, yeh

                    <strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
                    혀끝에 건전지 pop explosion
                    잠깐 쉬어갈 땐 slime vacation

                    <strong>[Post-Verse]</strong>
                    Guys 아찔아찔한 롤러코스터
                    떨어지기 1초 전 느낌 알지
                    (We know that feelings)
                    가끔은 조금 위험해도 돼
                    엄마 몰래 자물쇠를 열어봐

                    <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
                    어제 했던 건 벌써 지루해
                    더 더 더 강한 popping이 필요해
                    책상 넘어 하늘과 hi-five해
                    레몬 라임 오렌지를 가득 chew yeh

                    <strong>[Chorus]</strong>
                    더 더 더 강한 popping이 필요해
                    레몬 라임 오렌지를 가득 chew, yeh

                    이건 어쩌면 나라에서 허락한
                    우리끼리만 숨겨둔 유일한
                    자 아무에게나 허락된 게 아냐
                    입안 가득 터뜨려

                    <strong>[Refrain]</strong>
                    Let's pump it up, pump it up, pump it up (Pump it up)
                    Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
                    자 아무에게나 허락되는 게 아냐
                    입안 가득 터뜨려 봐

                    <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
                    찌릿찌릿 전류처럼 묘해
                    더 더 더 강한 popping이 필요해
                    이걸론 부족해 더 센 걸 원해
                    레몬 라임 오렌지를 가득 chew, yeh

                    <strong>[Chorus]</strong>
                    더 더 더 강한 popping이 필요해
                    레몬 라임 오렌지를 가득 chew, yeh

                    The electrifying static you're a popping star
                    The dull feeling in my head, the good feeling my love

                    Ah, perhaps this is the fireworks
                    That I can feel if I chew a mouthful of stardust
                    The stinging feeling that is filled inside my mouth
                    Something sweet is melting me down
                    Tingle, tingle, it's odd like an electric current
                    I need popping that is more, more, more strong

                    This is not enough, I want something stronger

                    Do you want to hide in this game?

                    Alright, in this time and space
                    If I could stay here forever
                    I would take a trip through this dungeon
                    This place we ran away to, forever
                    just stay
                    It will be alright, alright, alright

                    (Alright)
                    It will be alright, alright, alright
                    (Alright)
                    It will be alright, alright, alright

                    Do I have to break this stage, become an adult
                    In order to do well
                    I want to live as a boy forever
                    Oh the dark maze
                    And the tangled bushes are twisted
                    Oh I even like the monster in the forest

                    Alright even if you call me a bug in a derailed error
                    Our chosen paths are boring
                    This place we ran away to, forever
                    just stay
                    It will be alright, alright, alright

                    (Alright)
                    It will be alright, alright, alright
                    (Alright)
                    It will be alright, alright, alright

                    It's a fatal error
                    But it's peaceful (Alright)
                    Stop this time for a bit
                    Oh I want to stay (Alright)
                    (Alright)
                    It will be alright alright alright

                <h2>MAGIC ISLAND</h2>
                <p class="modal-songs-description-magic">'Magic Island' is a song in the acoustic pop genre that stands out for its minimalist composition of piano, concise rhythm, and whistle sound. 
                    It tells the story of recalling our story again on the island we first met when we are tired and exhausted. It recalls a pure and trouble-free childhood and provides a small healing to those of us who are losing our bright and shining selves. 
                    The lyrics, which are lamentable in the lyrical voice of TOMORROW X TOGETHER, warmly envelop the hearts of listeners. </p>

                <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
                <p class="lyrics-magic">
                    <strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
                    별들도 잠에 든 이 밤
                    익숙하고 낯선 이 강
                    잿빛의 도시를 넘어가
                    홀로 날 기다린 걸까
                    우리의 서툴던 약속과
                    비밀이 시작된 작은 섬

                    <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
                    기억해? 너와내 별의 노래
                    그 안의 우린 별이었지
                    꿈으로 빛나던 그 멜로디
                    잊지 말아줘 영원히

                    <strong>[Chorus]</strong>
                    이 곳은 우리의 start line
                    우리의 start line
                    함께 본 그 날의 starlight
                    그 밤을 잊으면 안돼
                    이 곳을 잊으면 안돼

                    <strong>[Post-Chorus]</strong>
                    Mm-mm, mm-mm
                   
                    <strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
                    결국 물거품이 될까
                    꿈도 다 추억이 될까
                    표류가 되어버린 이 항해, yeah
                    웃는 법을 잊은 듯해
                    회색 현실의 끝에
                    또 어둠이 날 부를 때

                    <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
                    기억해? 이곳에 있던 우리
                    그날의 우린 별이었지
                    이 섬에 남겨놓은 작은 노래
                    잊지 말아줘 영원히

                    <strong>[Chorus]</strong>
                    이 곳은 우리의 start line
                    우리의 start line
                    함께 본 그 날의 starlight
                    그 밤을 잊으면 안돼
                    이 곳을 잊으면 안돼

                    <strong>[Bridge]</strong>
                    누군가 내 이름을 불렀지 (Mm-mm)
                    색이 다른 눈동자의 저 고양이 (Mm-mm)
                    그 눈에 비친 나는 지쳐있어 여전히 (Mm-mm)
                    But 잠들면 안돼 쓰러지면 안돼 (Mm-mm)


                    <strong>[Chorus]</strong>
                    이 곳을 잊지마 start line (Mm-mm)
                    우리의 start line (Mm-mm)
                    함께 본 그 날의 starlight (Mm-mm)
                    그 밤을 잊으면 안돼 (Mm-mm)
                    이 곳을 잊으면 안돼 (Mm-mm)

                    <strong>[Outro]</strong>
                    Start line (I miss you, I miss you; Mm-mm)
                    너와 내 island (I miss you, I miss you; Mm-mm)
                    마법을 시작해 right now (I miss you, I miss you; Mm-mm)
                    이름을 잊으면 안돼
                    마법이 풀리지 않게

                <p class="lyrics-magic">
                    This night when even the stars are asleep
                    This river that's both familiar and unfamiliar
                    Go through the grey city
                    Were you waiting for me alone
                    Our clumsy promise
                    And the small island where our secret started

                    Remember? The song of my and your star
                    We were stars inside it
                    The melody that shone with dreams
                    Don't forget it Forever

                    This place is our start line
                    Our star line
                    The starlight that we saw together
                    Don't forget that night
                    Don't forget this place

                    Would everything go up in smoke
                    Would our dreams become a memory
                    This voyage that has become a flotsam
                    I think I forgot how to smile
                    At the end of this grey reality
                    When darkness calls on me again

                    Remember? We were here together
                    On that day we were stars
                    The small song that we left on this island
                    Don't forget it Forever

                    This place is our start line
                    Our star line
                    The starlight that we saw together
                    Don't forget that night
                    Don't forget this place

                    Somebody called my name
                    That cat with eyes of different colors
                    The me reflected on those eyes are still tired
                    But I can’t fall asleep, I can’t collapse

                    This place is our start line
                    Our star line
                    The starlight that we saw together
                    Don't forget that night
                    Don't forget this place

                    Start line
                    Yours and my island
                    Start the magic right now
                    Don't forget the name
                    So that the magic won't become undone
                </p>
