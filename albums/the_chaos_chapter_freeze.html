    <div class="album-info-freeze">
        <p>Following the gradual and progressive successes of their 'Dream Chapter' album series, TOMORROW X TOGETHER reached a new global high with their third EP, minisode1 : Blue Hour, which was released in October last year.
        Having further cemented their position as 'Leaders of K-pop's 4th Generation' and voices of the global teen experience, TOMORROW X TOGETHER make their return with their second studio album The Chaos Chapter: FREEZE, armed with great charm, musicality, and color.
        The new 'Chaos Chapter' begins where dreams have been swept away by the towering presence of the real world. Worldly events like the COVID-19 pandemic are violent assailants that crash upon the boy's once peaceful life. As his world crumbles away, the boy feels insignificant, empty, and frozen. 
        It isn't until 'you' appear before him that he begins to see more. With 'you,'' he experiences love and believes, unequivocally, that 'you' are his real and only world.</p>

    <h2>ANTI-ROMANTIC</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freeze">The song "Anti Romantic", which marks the beginning of "Chaos Chapter: FREEZE", is an electronic pop genre that allows you to feel an emotional and energetic atmosphere at the same time. 
        It tells the story of 'I', who calls himself an 'Anti Romantic' because he wants to stay away from love that only hurts him even if he puts his whole heart into it, but in the end, he cannot prevent his feelings for 'you' from developing, so he is conflicted. 
        The song's emotional line, which begins with boyish vocals and a clear electric piano, and deepens with the addition of strong rhythmic instruments and synthesizers, is attractive.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-freeze"><strong>[Verse 1: Taehyun, Huening Kai]</strong>
        I don't know who loves me
        And I don't care 어차피 낭비
        설렘 따위
        좀 겁이 나니까
        달콤 쌉쌀한 chocolate
        끝 맛은 항상 같지
        Like saddest movies
        눈가엔 눈물만

        <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>
        난 알아 달콤한 love song
        맹세의 그 말도
        돌아서면 결국
        낯선 그 someone

        <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Soobin, Huening Kai, Beomgyu]</strong>
        Sorry, I'm an anti-romantic
        달아나고 싶어 저 멀리
        이미 널 쫓는 내 마음이
        작은 불씨로 타올라
        Sorry, I'm an anti-romantic
        더는 믿지 않아, romantic
        내 맘 전부를 다 불사르고
        까만 재만 남게 될까 두려워

        <strong>[Post-Chorus: Taehyun]</strong>
        La-la-la, la-la-la
        La-la-la, ah-ah-ah
        Ah-ah-ah

        <strong>[Verse 2: Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
        I know that you love me
        또 취하게 해 깊이
        넌 마치 champagne
        이럼 안되는데
        다 보이잖아 끝이
        숙취보다 지독히
        힘들 거잖아
        자, 이쯤에서 끝내

        <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai, Soobin]</strong>
        So stupid, 달콤한 love song
        사치스러운 rom-com
        행복했던 만큼
        계산서엔 red line

        <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Yeonjun, Huening Kai, Soobin]</strong>
        Sorry, I'm an anti-romantic
        달아나고 싶어 저 멀리
        이미 널 쫓는 내 마음이
        작은 불씨로 타올라
        Sorry, I'm an anti-romantic
        더는 믿지 않아, romantic
        내 맘 전부를 다 불사르고
        까만 재만 남게 될까 두려워

        <strong>[Post-Chorus: Beomgyu]</strong>
        La-la-la, la-la-la
        La-la-la, ah-ah-ah
        Ah-ah-ah

        <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Beomgyu, Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
        Sorry, I'm an anti-romantic
        달아나고 싶어 저 멀리
        이미 널 쫓는 내 마음이
        작은 불씨로 타올라
        Sorry, I'm an anti-romantic
        더는 믿지 않아, romantic
        내 맘 전부를 다 불사르고
        까만 재만 남게 될까 두려워

    <p class="lyrics-freeze">I don't know who loves me
        And I don't care, it's a waste anyway
        This romantic feeling
        I feel a little scared
        Sweet and bitter chocolate
        The ending taste is always the same
        Like saddest movies
        On my eyes, only tears

        I know
        Sweet love song
        The word of pledge
        Once you turn around
        They're a stranger, that someone

        Sorry I'm an anti-romantic
        I want to run far away
        Already, my heart that chases you
        Burns up in a small flame
        Sorry I'm an anti-romantic
        I don't trust it anymore, romantic
        That my heart will all burn away
        And only black soot will be left, I'm afraid

        I know that you love me
        It makes me deeply drunk again
        You're like a champagne
        This can't happen
        It can all be seen, the end
        It's more intense than a hangover
        It will be difficult
        Now, let's end it here

        So stupid
        Sweet love song
        Wasteful rom com
        As much as I was happy
        At the cashier, red line

        Sorry I'm an anti-romantic
        I want to run far away
        Already, my heart that chases you
        Burns up in a small flame
        Sorry I'm an anti-romantic
        I don't trust it anymore, romantic
        That my heart will all burn away
        And only black soot will be left, I'm afraid

        La-la-la, la-la-la
        La-la-la, ah-ah-ah
        Ah-ah-ah

        Sorry I'm an anti-romantic
        I want to run far away
        Already, my heart that chases you
        Burns up in a small flame
        Sorry I'm an anti-romantic
        I don't trust it anymore, romantic

    <h2>0X1 = LOVESONG (I KNOW I LOVE YOU)</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freeze">The title song '0X1=LOVESONG (I Know I Love You) feat. Seori' is an energetic song based on hybrid pop rock, which sings about the 'self-assured' love of a boy who believes that his love for you is as certain as the love he met in the chaos. 
        It is a story about meeting a girl (1) who approaches a boy with a hole (0) in his soul in a world where everything is zero, and the lyrics that seem to express a scene from a youth movie, the progression of dramatic songs, the rough yet delicate vocals of the members, and the featuring of Seori with a dreamy voice combine to leave a strong aftertaste. 
        American singer-songwriters and rock hip-hop artists Mod Sun and No Love For The Middle Child participated in the songwriting, while BTS's RM participated in the lyrics.</p>

        I know I love you

        <strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Beomgyu, Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
        이 제로의 세계 속
        I know you're my one and only (And only; And only)
        이 끝이 없던 어둠 속
        Like oh my god, so holy (So holy)
        뭐든 내 두 손끝에선 (끝에선)
        부리나케 도망가 멀리
        My life before you was a mess
        언제나 단 한 판 이길 수 없던 chess, oh, we

        <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
        무저갱의 바닥에서 (서)
        넌 유일하게 빛나던 gold (Gold)
        Now I can't stop thinking 'bout you
        When I'm sinking alone
        어느 날 내게 나타난 천사 (난 천사)
        데려가 줘 너의 hometown (너의 hometown)
        I know it's real, I can feel it

        <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
        난 문제 투성이 love sick
        길이 없었어

        All or nothing, I give all of you
        I know I love you

        <strong>[Verse 2: Soobin, Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
        아마 난 안될 거야
        천국엔 못 갈 거야
        어울리지 않아
        자리 따위 천국엔 없어
        뭐든 내 두 발끝에선 (끝에선)
        새까맣게 물들었었지
        My life before you was trash
        언제나 단 한 발 붙일 수 없던 match, oh, we

    <p class="lyrics-freeze">I know I love you

        In this world of zero
        I know you're my 1 & only
        In this endless night
        Like oh my god, so holy
        Whatever, at the tips of my two hands
        It quickly run far away
        My life before you was a mess
        Always, a chess game that I couldn't win even once
        Oh we

        At the bottom of the abyss
        You were a gold that uniquely shone
        Now I can't stop thinking bout you
        When I'm sinking alone
        An angel that appeared before me one day
        Bring me to your hometown
        I know it's real I can feel like

        I'm filled with troubles, love sick
        There was no road
        It was okay if I died
        I'm a loser in this game
        The only law in this world
        Save me

        I probably can't do it
        I can't go to heaven
        I don't fit in
        There's no place for me in heaven
        Whatever is at the tip of my two feet
        Turned black
        My life before you was trash
        Always a match that you couldn't light a single one
        Oh we

        In this place that was only ice
        You were the glow that uniquely shone
        Now I can't stop thinking bout you

    <h2>MAGIC</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freeze">This is the first English song released by TOMORROW X TOGETHER since their debut. It is a cheerful and trendy disco-pop genre that depicts the story of a magical you who melts me from being frozen. 
        It is a cheerful and refreshing song that stands out for its chorus melody that you won't forget even if you listen to it once and the part where you can clap and sing along. 
        In particular, the dynamic performance of "Magic Moves", a choreography that expresses the appearance of magic scattering in the sky with hand gestures, attracts attention with dynamic performances.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
    <p class="lyrics-freeze"><strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Taehyun]</strong>
        Remember how I used to be so
        Stuck in one place so cold
        Feeling like my heart just froze
        Nowhere to go with no one, nobody
        Suddenly you came through
        Making me make a move
        Nobody got it like you
        I can't look away, I can't

        <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai, Beomgyu]</strong>
        'Cause baby, you're a real one, real one
        Teaching me to feel something so strong (Strong)
        We could reach out and grab it

        <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin, Huening Kai]</strong>
        Oh, it's just like magic
        Feeling your touch, oh, it's a rush
        No one else has it
        Oh, just like magic (Just like magic)
        Oh, it's just like magic
        Holding me tight
        Giving me life
        Oh, it's magic (Magic)
        Oh, it's magic (Oh, it's just like magic)
     
        <strong>[Post-Chorus: Taehyun, Soobin]</strong>
        Oh, it's magic, oh, it's magic
        Just like magic
        Oh, it's magic
        Magic

        <strong>[Verse 2: Huening Kai, Beomgyu, Yeonjun]</strong>
        Used to be so afraid
        'Fraid of all the games we played
        Waited around all day
        Nowhere to go with no one, nobody
        Hoping someone would save me
        'Til you called out my name
        Something in me just changed
        Got me awake, got me

        <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Beomgyu]</strong>
        'Cause baby, you're a real one, real one
        Teaching me to feel something so strong (Strong)
        We could reach out and grab it

        <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Beomgyu, Huening Kai]</strong>
        Oh, it's just like magic
        Feeling your touch, oh, it's a rush
        No one else has it
        Oh, just like magic (Just like magic)
        Oh, it's just like magic
        Holding me tight
        Giving me life
        Oh, it's magic (Magic)
        Oh, it's magic (Oh, it's just like magic)

        <strong>[Bridge: All, Taehyun]</strong>
        Everybody clap your hands (No, no, no)
        If you've got a broken heart just take a chance (Oh, oh, no, no, no)
        I say everybody clap your hands
        If you've got a broken heart just take a chance (Magic, magic)
        Everybody clap your hands
        If you've got a broken heart just take a chance (Chance)
        I say everybody clap your hands
        If you've got a broken heart just take a chance (Ooh)
        Everybody clap your hands
        If you've got a broken heart just take a chance (Chance)
        I say everybody clap your hands
        If you've got a broken heart just take a chance, say

        <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin, Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
        Oh, it's just like magic (Just like magic, yeah, eh)

        <strong>[Outro: All, Taehyun]</strong>
        Everybody clap your hands
        (Oh, it's magic)
        If you've got a broken heart just take a chance
        (Oh, it's magic) Just like magic
        I say everybody clap your hands (Oh)
        (Oh, it's magic) Magic
        If you've got a broken heart just take a chance, say

    <h2>ICE CREAM (SMALL BUT EVIL HAPPINESS)</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freeze">It is a song in the minimalist dance-pop genre, and it deals with 'small evil deeds', which are happiness brought about by small and slightly mean thoughts, rather than 'small deeds', which are small but certain happiness. 
        In an era where happiness itself seems a bit selfish, he humorously unravels his honest feelings with villainous lyrics, a synth bass sound that catches his ears, and a sly and relaxed vocal style. 
        Member Soobin participated in the lyrics.</p>

    <p class="modal-songs-description-freeze">It is an attractive hip-hop song with a trendy atmosphere created by dreamy synthesizers and refreshing piano sounds, and you can feel the different charm of TOMORROW X TOGETHER. 
        The story of the choices faced in life is expressed in comparison to a balance game where you have to choose only one of the two, raising consensus. It takes the setting of 'The Cougar Escaped from the Zoo' from TOMORROW X TOGETHER's second mini-album 'Dream Chapter: ETERNITY' and looks back on 'what choice I would have made if it were that cougar' from the perspective of a domesticated boy.

    <h2>NO RULES</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freeze">It is a bright and exciting retro-punk-pop genre song that tells the story of a teenager who faces a world where rules have disappeared after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
        With a refreshing retro sound, danceable punk grooves, and colorful rap, it is a song that anyone can enjoy. The lyrics of 'New Rules', a song from their first studio album 'Dream Chapter: MAGIC', capture the confusion they feel while living in the present where 'no rules' has become the new rule, which is also intriguing.

        It tells the story of a companion who met in loneliness. After meeting 'Sputnik', the only one with warmth in a world that has lost its warmth, the boy has a new hope and asks to join him on his long journey.

    <h2>FROST</h2>
    <p class="modal-songs-description-freeze">It is a trap-based hyperpop genre, and the magnificent electric guitar sound catches the ear from the beginning. The intense and unique sound created by the rough-textured percussion and heavy bass is complemented by TOMORROW X TOGETHER's experimental vocal sound. 
        After realizing his fate for the first time, he unraveled the confused boy's mind by comparing it to 'frost'. 
        The song is linked to the original story 'The Star Seekers', which depicts the growth of five special boys, and was written by artist Ashnikko, who is active mainly in London, and member Yeonjun participated in the lyrics.</p>
