                <h2>GHOSTING</h2>
                <p class="modal-songs-description-bluehour">It is a song in the Nu Gaze genre with an 80s sensibility added to indie rock, and was produced by EL CAPITXN. The sophisticated vocals of the five members and the vintage-inspired instrumental sound combine to mark the unique beginning of this album. 
                    'Ghosting' is a coined word that means the act of suddenly cutting off all communication with someone and disappearing. Soobin and Taehyun participated in the lyrics, expressing the boy's confused feelings after communication was cut off. 
                    It is a song that conveys the hope that 'you' will come back in the midst of frequent emotional changes due to the sudden loss of contact between the person you were talking to. 
                    The melody that can be listened to comfortably, the synthesizer with a trendy yet retro charm, and the refreshing electric guitar and chorus line enhance the song's perfection.

                <p class="lyrics-bluehour"><strong>[Intro: Soobin, Huening Kai]</strong>
                사라진 너, 사 사라진
                희미한 유령처럼 사 사라진
                사라진 너, 사 사라진
                희미한 유령처럼 사 사라진
                메아리만 맴도는 방에
                나 혼자서만 떠돌아 내내
                난 유령처럼
                유령처럼

                <strong>[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>
                네모난 화면에 가득한 메시지들
                티키타카 좋았던 우린데
                뭔가 좀 이상해 벌써 일주일째
                여전히 숫자 날 반겨 1만

                <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Taehyun, Beomgyu, Soobin]</strong>
                멍하니 바라봐 쓸쓸하게 띄워놓은 window
                오른쪽엔 내 얘기만 뒹굴어 홀로
                점점 더 불안해져
                All day, all day, all day, all day

                <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
                한순간 사라진 너, 사 사라진
                희미한 유령처럼 사 사라진
                허공에 묻곤 해
                난 너한테 뭐길래 (뭐길래)
                한순간 사라진 너, 사 사라진
                희미한 유령처럼 사 사라진
                메아리만 맴도는 방에
                나 혼자서만 떠돌아 내내
                난 유령처럼

                <strong>[Verse 2: Soobin, Huening Kai]</strong>
                바라봐 멍하니 새롭게 올라온
                네 Hashtag '오늘_하늘참_예쁨'
                믿을 수 없어 다 이미 내 세상 속에
                너는 logout 이제야 알아

                <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Yeonjun, Taehyun, Soobin]</strong>
                밤을 새 오늘도 뜬 눈으로 like a zombie
                찾고 있어 대화 속에 이별의 징조
                아직 난 모르겠어
                All day, all day, all day, all day

                <strong>[Chorus: Beomgyu, Taehyun]</strong>
                한순간 사라진 너, 사 사라진
                희미한 유령처럼 사 사라진
                허공에 묻곤 해
                난 너한테 뭐길래 (뭐길래)
                한순간 사라진 너, 사 사라진
                희미한 유령처럼 사 사라진
                메아리만 맴도는 방에
                나 혼자서만 떠돌아 내내
                난 유령처럼

                <strong>[Bridge: Huening Kai, Beomgyu, Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
                사실 나도 알아
                ‘대답 없음’ 그게 대답인 걸
                익숙해지지 않아
                혼자가 돼 버린 게
                사진 속의 우리처럼 (처럼)
                어서 다시 돌아가야만 해 (다시, 해)
                난 아직 여기 있는데 (난 아직 여기 있는데)
                난 아직 여기 있는데

                <strong>[Chorus: Yeonjun, Soobin, Taehyun, Huening Kai]</strong>
                한순간 사라진 너, 사 사라진 (사 사라진)
                희미한 유령처럼 사 사라진
                허공에 묻곤 해 (Ooh)
                난 너한테 뭐길래 (뭐길래) (Ooh, ooh, no, no)
                한순간 사라진 너, 사 사라진 (Ooh)
                희미한 유령처럼 사 사라진
                메아리만 맴도는 방에
                나 혼자서만 떠돌아 내내
                난 유령처럼

                <h2>BLUE HOUR [5 시 53 분의 하늘에서 발견한 너와 나]</h2>
                <p class="modal-songs-description-bluehour">
                    It is a dance song in the disco genre that allows you to feel the sweet and energetic energy. The catchy synth sound, rhythmic guitar and bass create a danceable track, a bright and exciting melody, and the boyish vocals of the five members complete TOMORROW X TOGETHER's unique disco. 
                    It contains the complex emotions of boys who look at the sky at 5:53 and experience a familiar and unfamiliar world and feel both fear and beauty at the same time. Here, 5:53 is the sunset time in October, when this album is released, and the sky is the most beautiful time. 
                    However, at the same time, it is also the 'time of the dog and the wolf', where the shadows quickly thicken and it is difficult to distinguish the existence in front of us. 
                    As the sun goes down and the shadows shine, he feels lonely in a situation where he doesn't know if the friend in front of him is really his friend, but even at moments like this, the boys just hope that they feel the same way with each other.

                <p class="lyrics-bluehour">Blue hour!
                I really hate awkwardness,
                I just laugh
                Baby I know we were special
                The only one in this world special
                Those eyes that are like that empty present box of yours
                In that sun that is setting, you and I
                Yeah yeah I can

                But it's you
                You're the one that I want
                You
                Everything that I want
                Blue
                The blue that fell next to me, everything is changing
                This different (異) world at 5:53 is beautiful </p>
                <p class="modal-note-bluehour">[note: “이 세계/ie-se-gye" in common Korean is directly translated as “this world” but the Chinese character in the parenthesis means “special” and is also pronounced “ie,” so “이 세계/ie-se-gye” in this context means “special world”.]</p> 
                <p class="lyrics-bluehour">Cuz of imagination
                At that sky

                Cuz of imagination
                At that instant
                Can you feel the rush

                I wanna stay
                (Can you feel the rush)
                (Can you feel the rush)
                At the time between the dog and the wolf
                I want to be trapped inside magic
                Blue hour!

                You are my own special
                My one and only special
                The door to dreams opens
                You in my memory comes to life
                So tell me what to do
                The clue to stop the sun
                I saw you that would smile
                Woah ohh yeah

                Blue
                The sunset that is dyed at the moment, everything changes
                Us at 5:53 is constantly beautiful

                Cuz of imagination
                At that sky

                My time machine, that sunset light that is fading
                To be honest, I know that it's over
                The sun is down down down down down
                Before you disappear in that night, I save the fantastical you in my eyes

                Cuz of imagination
                At that sky
                The orange-colored magic

                <h2>WE LOST THE SUMMER</h2>
                <p class="modal-songs-description-bluehour">It tells the story of teenagers who are going through a completely different world due to the 'COVID-19' pandemic. 
                    They sing about their daily lives, which were extremely ordinary, such as having fun on the playground and listening to music while handing out earphones in the classroom, but now they have been lost. 
                    It is a dancehall genre with a faint yet refreshing feel, and the catchy pluck and guitar sound add to the charm of the song. The lyrics, which convey the anxiety that comes after the daily life that was taken for granted disappears and the confusion of not knowing how to accept this situation, evoke sympathy from listeners. 
                    British pop artist Charli XCX is involved in the overall work of the song, attracting even more attention.

                <p class="lyrics-bluehour"><strong>[Intro: Taehyun, Yeonjun]</strong>
                Ah-ah, ah-ah
                Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
                We lost the summer, hmm, mm
                Ah-ah, ah-ah
                Ah-ah, ah, ah

                <strong>[Verse 1: Huening Kai, Taehyun]</strong>
                달리던 축구화 시끄러운 열기들 (너와)
                나눠 몰래 들었던 내 earphone은 (이젠 나만)
                유행한 노래, 교실 안 콘서트 (but now)
                We lost the sunset, now don't know what to do

                <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Beomgyu]</strong>
                내 달력 위 first day
                뒤 수많은 first day
                끝이 없는 3월 1일의 저녁에
                난 남겨져 있어
                내 화이트데인 이미 wasted
                Keep lovesick, no vaccine
                날씨를 잃어버린 우리 시곈
                겨울에서 멈춰 서 있어

                <strong>[Chorus: Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
                'Cause we lost the summer
                When we lost each other
                나의 계절을 돌려줘
                Oh, it's all gone
                영원한 winter
                Now I just miss ya
                우릴 돌려줘

                <strong>[Post-Chorus: Taehyun, Soobin, Huening Kai, Yeonjun, *Beomgyu*]</strong>
                하루 이틀, 일주일 또 한 달, 일 년을 (oh oh)
                나 홀로 걷고 있어 서툰 이 제자리걸음
                We lost the summer
                악몽 같은 한 주를 또 한 달, 일 년을 (oh oh)
                *널 다시 보고 싶어 빛나던 우리의 여름*
                Long gone, we lost the summer

                <strong>[Verse 2: Taehyun, Soobin]</strong>
                다니던 café의 문이 꽉 잠기고 (And how)
                한숨을 숨겨 갑갑한 mask 뒤로 (여기 남아)
                표정이 없는 내 얼굴이 싫어 (You know)
                You was my sunset, I wanna make it work

                <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>

                뒤 수많은 first day
                끝이 없는 3월 1일의 저녁에
                난 남겨져 있어
                그 영원한 방학이
                반복되는 아침
                날씨를 잃어버린 우리 시곈
                겨울에서 망가져 있어

                사라지지 마 (지금 달려가)
                너를 찾아 (우릴 잊지 마)
                We go on

                One day and two, a week and a month, a year
                I'm walking alone, this awkward walking on the spot
                We lost the summer
                This nightmarish week, now a month, a year
                I want to meet you again, our summer that was shining
                Long gone we lost the summer

                The café that I went to has now closed (and how)
                I hide my sigh behind this stuffy mask (Remaining here)
                I hate my face without expression (you know)
                You was my sunset, I wanna make it work

                The first day on my calendar, the numerous first day afterwards
                The evening of the endless March 1st, that's where I'm left
                That endless school break
                The repeating morning
                Our clock that lost the weather
                Is broken at winter

                Cause we lost the summer
                When we lost each other
                Give me back the season
                Oh, it's all gone
                An eternal winter
                Now I just miss ya
                Give me back 'us'
                Oh, it's all gone
                We lost the summer

                Hot summer time (We were)
                That day we were wishing for (Just a normal)
                Myself in summer (You in summer)
                Can't we go back
                Hot summer time (summer time)
                Don't disappear (Running now)
                Searching for you (Don't forget us)
                We go on

                We lost the summer
                When we lost each other
                Give me back the season
                Oh, it's all gone
                An eternal winter
                Now I just miss ya
                Give me back 'us'
                Oh, it's all gone
                We lost the summer

                One day and two, a week and a month, a year
                I'm walking alone, this awkward walking on the spot
                We lost the summer
                This nightmarish week, now a month, a year
                I want to meet you again, our summer that was shining
                Long gone we lost the summer

                <h2>WISHLIST</h2>
                <p class="modal-songs-description-bluehour">The song, written by Yeonjun, Taehyun, and Hueningkai, captures the trembling heart of a boy who wants to give the perfect gift for his crush's birthday but is anxious because the other person doesn't tell him what she wants. 
                    The cute and adorable lyrics are impressive, and it is a pop-rock genre with a bright atmosphere that evokes a sense of youth. 
                    The refreshing guitar playing and catchy melody harmonize to catch your ears, and the chorus of the five members adds to convey a cheerful energy.

                It's harder than an exam
                To guess your heart
                I've been searching all day
                Your feed on the timeline (What do you like?)
                Remove it from me, the question mark
                “Guess” you keep on pretending you don’t know
                Why do you keep laughing
                Time is flowing by

                I stay up all night again today

                Where did you exactly hide it
                Tell me the secret
                Say now! Say now! oh yeah
                Say now! Say now!
                Please tell me now

                A useful something
                No, pretty trash
                How about romantic
                I can't make a guess (What's the best present?)
                A wishlist that I've filled up in my phone
                Everything suddenly forms a meaning
                A jewel box with a star called you inside
                Is overflowing in my heart

                Now I'll send it to you

                Where did you hide it
                Tell me the secret

                Tell me what's your wish, yeah

                Rather than getting it all wrong
                I might just confess
                I like you

                Where did you hide it
