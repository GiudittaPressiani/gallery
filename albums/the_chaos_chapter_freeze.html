        <p>Following the gradual and progressive successes of their 'Dream Chapter' album series, TOMORROW X TOGETHER reached a new global high with their third EP, minisode1 : Blue Hour, which was released in October last year.
        Having further cemented their position as 'Leaders of K-pop's 4th Generation' and voices of the global teen experience, TOMORROW X TOGETHER make their return with their second studio album The Chaos Chapter: FREEZE, armed with great charm, musicality, and color.
        The new 'Chaos Chapter' begins where dreams have been swept away by the towering presence of the real world. Worldly events like the COVID-19 pandemic are violent assailants that crash upon the boy's once peaceful life. As his world crumbles away, the boy feels insignificant, empty, and frozen. 
        It isn't until 'you' appear before him that he begins to see more. With 'you,'' he experiences love and believes, unequivocally, that 'you' are his real and only world.</p>
