                <h2>Drama</h2>
                <p class="modal-songs-description-eternity">It is a song in the funk pop genre that combines funky guitar rhythms, catchy piano, and charming brass. 
                  It tells the story that he accidentally became friends with 'you', who was the main character at school, and spent the drama-like time he had dreamed of, but 'you' was the main character and 'I' was an extra, and there was no drama for 'me'. 
                  As the title suggests, a story like this makes you feel like you're watching a drama. The upbeat rhythm, colorful instrument sounds, and catchy melodic lines that contrast with the lyrics captivate the ears.

                <p class="lyrics-eternity"><strong>[Verse 1: Beomgyu, Taehyun, Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
                  저 환호성 난 매일 그 뒤 yeah
                  쿨한 미소는 너의 주무기
                  처음 만났던 운동장의 court
                  나도 주인공만 같던 movie scene
                  네 패스 하나에 바로 나도 그 scene 안에
                  Spotlight 불빛 아래 내 자리
                  날 향해 던져준 너의 다정한 그 말에
                  나도 한순간에 주연이

                  <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
                  Oh oh, 내디뎌 한발
                  Oh oh, give me a highlight
                  Oh oh, 꿈꿔온 drama
                  Time to show my play

                  스티커 사진 속 넌 주인님
                  아이구 죄송, 넘은 내 선
                  엑스트라 1은 오늘도 통편집
                  함께 하고 있지만 마음이 이상해
                  자꾸 CG같애 내 몸이

                  작고 시시한 내 결말이

                  <strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
                  Oh oh, 잘 가 내 망상
                  Oh oh, 다가온 bye bye
                  Oh oh, 널 위한 drama

                <p class="lyrics-eternity">Those cheers, I'm always behind it
                A cool smile is your main weapon
                The sports field court where I met you for the first time
                A movie scene where I felt like a main character
                I'm in that scene with your one pass
                My place under the light of the spotlight
                Those kind words that you threw towards me
                I became a lead actor in that moment

                Oh oh I take one step
                Oh oh give me a highlight
                Oh oh the drama that I dreamed of
                Time to show my play

                This is my drama
                This drama that I dreamed of
                This is my drama

                Those cheers, I'm nobody
                You in the photo sticker is my master
                Oh no, I'm sorry, I stepped over my line
                Extra 1 is completely edited out today as well
                I'm with you but my mind is strange
                My body constantly feels like a CG
                In front of the door called exit that came to me all of a sudden
                My small and tedious ending

                Oh oh goodbye my delusion
                Oh oh approaching bye-bye
                Oh oh drama for you
                Time to get away

                This is your drama
                This is your drama
                This is your drama

                Oh my god
                Your blinding drama
                I'm I'm none of your business
                I'm I'm none of your business
                Oh my good
                A magical drama
                I'm I'm none of your business
                I'm I'm none of your business

                Oh oh this drama on top of a stage
                Oh oh still glorious
                Oh oh we have no problem
                Nothing but my name
                Oh oh goodbye my delusion
                Oh oh approaching bye-bye
                Oh oh drama for you
                Time to get away

                <h2>Can't You See Me [세계가 불타버린 밤, 우린...]</h2>
                <p class="modal-songs-description-eternity">It is a trendy pop genre song with a trap beat and an electro synth. 
                  It tells the story of the confusion and fear experienced in front of a burned world after a magical moment, as well as the loneliness caused by the cracks in friendships. 
                  As befits the lyrics, which contain the feelings of confused boys, you can feel a slightly melancholic and dark atmosphere. It starts with an emotional piano melody, and with unique sound effects and instrumental sounds, it is a song that coexists with a rough yet delicate feeling. 
                  It features whispering vocals and unique narration sections, doubling the fun of listening.

                <h3>Lyrics</h3>  
                <p class="lyrics-eternity"><strong>[Intro: Taehyun]</strong>
                See me
                See me
                Can't you see me?
                Can't you see me?
                Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

                <strong>[Verse 1: Taehyun, Huening Kai, Beomgyu]</strong>
                I'm yours, you're mine, 세계의 비밀
                마법 같던 영원의 그 약속
                별빛 아래 꽃피운 둘만의 Scintilla
                Now see them burn in fire (폐허가 된 여기 재가 된 memories)

                <strong>[Refrain: Yeonjun, Beomgyu]</strong>
                (Oh) Together, together, oh woah
                (Oh) We forever, forever, you know
                약속했던 둘만의 somethin', somethin'
                불꽃 속에서 넌 등을 돌리지

                <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Taehyun]</strong>
                무너진 모래성, who's a liar?
                세계의 끝에서 춤추는 fire
                안 들리니? 널 찾는 내 목소리
                또 홀로 남겨지는 나 ("구해줘")

                <strong>[Chorus: Hueningkai, Taehyun, Beomgyu]</strong>
                Can't you see me?
                마법의 그날처럼 say "believe me"
                불타버린 내 맘을
                Come and feel me, feel me
                Oh, can't you see me?
                My friends don't understand me, no

                <strong>[Post-Chorus: Hueningkai, Yeonjun, Soobin]</strong>
                Can't you see me?
                Friends don't understand me, understand me anymore
                Friends don't understand me anymore, more
                Can't you see me?
                Friends don't understand me, understand me anymore
                Friends don't understand me anymore, more (Yeah, yeah)

                <strong>[Verse 2: Beomgyu, Huening Kai, Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
                원망해, 널 참 많이
                'Cause you don't understand me
                원망이 멈추게 please
                내 손을 잡아줘, 다시

                <strong>[Refrain: Taehyun, Beomgyu, Yeonjun]</strong>
                (Oh) Together, together, oh woah
                (Oh) We forever, forever, you know (Ooh, woah)
                꿈속에서 사라진 somethin', somethin'
                남겨진 섬, 잊혀진 그 멜로디 (그 멜로디)

                <strong>[Pre-Chorus: Soobin, Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
                무너진 모래성, who's a liar? (Ooh, woah)
                세계의 끝에서 춤추는 fire (Ooh, woah)
                안 들리니? 널 찾는 내 목소리 (목소리)
                또 홀로 남겨지는 나 ("구해줘")

                <strong>[Chorus: Taehyun, Huening Kai, Yeonjun]</strong>
                Can't you see me?
                마법의 그날처럼 say, "believe me" (Yeah)
                불타버린 내 맘을
                Come and feel me, feel me
                Oh, can't you see me? (Can't you, can't you see me?)
                My friends don't understand me, no

                <strong>[Post-Chorus: Taehyun, Beomgyu, Hueningkai]</strong>
                Can't you see me?
                Friends don't understand me, understand me anymore (More)
                Friends don't understand me anymore, more
                Can't you see me?
                Friends don't understand me, understand me anymore (My friends don't understand me anymore, more)
                Friends don't understand me anymore, more

                <strong>[Bridge: Soobin, Yeonjun]</strong>
                Bad, bad
                그저 아픈 꿈이길 바래
                Sad, sad
                돌려놔줘 나를 네 옆에

                <strong>[Chorus: Hueningkai, Taehyun, Beomgyu]</strong>
                Can't you see me? (Oh, ooh, ooh)
                마법의 그날처럼 say, "believe me" (Just feel me)
                불타버린 내 맘을
                Come and feel me, feel me (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
                Oh, can't you see me?
                My friends don't understand me, no

                <strong>[Post-Chorus: Hueningkai, Yeonjun, Taehyun, Soobin]</strong>
                Can't you see me?
                Friends don't understand me, understand me anymore (My friends, they don't)
                Friends don't understand me any (Shh) more
                Can't you see me? (Woah)
                Friends don't understand me, understand me anymore (More)
                Friends don't understand me anymore, more, more

                <h3>English Translation</h3>
                <p class="lyrics-eternity">I'm yours, you were mine, secrets of the world
                That eternal promise was like magic
                Our Scintilla bloomed underneath the starlight
                Now see them burn in fire

                Turned into ruins, our memories into ashes
                Together together
                We forever forever, you know
                Our promised something something
                You turn your back when the fire is burning

                Crumbled sand castle, who's a liar
                Dancing fire at the end of the world
                Can't you hear it? My voice searching for you
                Once again, I'm left alone (“Save me”)

                Can't you see me?
                Like on that magical day, say “Believe me”
                My heart incinerated, come and feel me feel me
                Oh can't you see me?
                My friends don't understand me, no

                Can't you see me?

                Friends don't understand me understand me anymore
                Friends don't understand me anymore more

                With resentment, my heart is heavy
                Cuz you don't understand me
                To make my resentment stop, please
                Take my hand, once again

                Together together
                We forever forever, you know
                Gone in a dream something something
                Abandoned island, that forgotten melody

                Crumbled sand castle, who's a liar
                Dancing fire at the end of the world
                Can't you hear it? My voice searching for you
                Once again, I'm left alone (“Save me”)

                Can't you see me?
                Like on that magical day, say “Believe me”
                My heart incinerated, come and feel me feel me
                Oh can't you see me?
                My friends don't understand me, no

                Friends don't understand me understand me anymore
                Friends don't understand me anymore more

                Bad bad I hope it's just a painful dream
                Sad sad return me to your side again

                Can't you see me?
                Like on that magical day, say “Believe me”
                My heart incinerated, come and feel me feel me
